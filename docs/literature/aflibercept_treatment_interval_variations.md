# Aflibercept 2mg Treatment Interval Variations and Outcomes

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes findings from multiple clinical trials and real-world studies on aflibercept (Eylea) 2mg dosing variations, comparing outcomes across different treatment intervals and protocols. The data spans from rigid fixed dosing (VIEW trials) to flexible treat-and-extend approaches (ALTAIR, Maruko, FRB!).

## Treatment Protocol Comparison

### 1. Fixed Dosing (VIEW 1/2 - q8w Protocol)

**Protocol**: 3 monthly loading doses → Fixed q8w (every 2 months)

**Outcomes at 52 weeks**:
- Visual acuity gain: +7.9 to +8.9 letters
- Proportion gaining ≥15 letters: 30.6-31.4%
- Mean injections Year 1: 7.5
- Dry retina achievement: 63.4-71.9%
- CRT reduction: -128.5 to -149.2 μm

**Key finding**: Minor CRT fluctuations (8-17 μm) between injections with no impact on vision

### 2. Treat-and-Extend with 2/4-week Adjustments (ALTAIR)

**Protocol**: 3 monthly loading doses → T&E with 2 or 4-week adjustments
- Minimum interval: 8 weeks
- Maximum interval: 16 weeks

**Outcomes at 96 weeks**:
- Visual acuity gain: +6.1 to +7.6 letters
- Mean maximum interval achieved: 12.2-12.5 weeks
- Proportion at 16-week interval: 41.5-46.3%
- Mean injections over 2 years: 10.4
- Dry retina at 96 weeks: 67.5%

**Key finding**: 56.9-60.2% achieved ≥12-week intervals by week 96

### 3. Conservative T&E with 1-month Adjustments (Maruko)

**Protocol**: 3 monthly loading doses → T&E with 1-month adjustments
- Maximum interval: 12 weeks (more conservative)

**Outcomes at 104 weeks**:
- Visual acuity gain: +6.5 letters
- Proportion at 3-month interval: 60.8%
- Mean injections over 2 years: 13.0
- Dry macula achievement: 72.2%
- CRT reduction: -105 μm

**Key finding**: 51% who reached 3-month intervals maintained them throughout study

### 4. Real-World T&E vs PRN (FRB! Registry)

**T&E Protocol**: Injections at ≥83% of visits
**PRN Protocol**: Injections at <83% of visits

**Outcomes at 24 months**:
- T&E visual gain: +4.2 letters (adjusted)
- PRN visual gain: +1.3 letters (adjusted)
- T&E injections: 14.9
- PRN injections: 9.8
- T&E maximum interval: ~70 days (10 weeks)

**Key finding**: T&E superior to PRN by 2.9 letters despite more injections

## Treatment Interval Effects on Outcomes

### Visual Acuity Response by Interval Length

| Maximum Interval | VA Gain (letters) | Study | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| 8 weeks (fixed) | +7.9 to +8.9 | VIEW | Best absolute gain |
| 12 weeks | +6.5 | Maruko | Conservative T&E |
| 16 weeks | +6.1 to +7.6 | ALTAIR | Extended T&E |
| Variable (real-world) | +4.2 | FRB! | T&E in practice |

### Anatomic Stability by Treatment Interval

| Protocol | Dry Retina Rate | CRT Fluctuation | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Fixed q8w | 63.4-71.9% | 8-17 μm | Acceptable fluctuation |
| T&E to 16w | 67.5% | Not reported | Similar to fixed |
| T&E to 12w | 72.2% | Not reported | Slightly better |

### Treatment Burden vs Outcomes Trade-off

| Protocol | 2-Year Injections | 2-Year VA Gain | Efficiency Ratio |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Fixed q8w | 11.2 | +6.3 letters | 0.56 letters/injection |
| T&E (ALTAIR) | 10.4 | +6.1-7.6 letters | 0.59-0.73 letters/injection |
| T&E (Maruko) | 13.0 | +6.5 letters | 0.50 letters/injection |
| T&E (real-world) | 14.9 | +4.2 letters | 0.28 letters/injection |

## Disease State Transitions with Different Intervals

### Immediate Post-Loading Response (Week 16)

| Study | Extended to ≥12 weeks | Remained <12 weeks | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| ALTAIR | 42.3-49.6% | 50.4-57.7% | 2/4-week adjustments |
| Maruko | 50.5% (to 12 weeks) | 49.5% | 1-month adjustments |

### Long-term Stability (2 years)

| Study | Maintained Maximum Interval | Required Shortening | Notes |
|-------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| ALTAIR | 41.5-46.3% at 16 weeks | Variable | Good durability |
| Maruko | 51% of early extenders | 49% of early extenders | Predictor of success |

## Treatment Discontinuation and Recurrence

### From Recurrence Study (Lind et al.)
- **Discontinuation criteria**: 3 consecutive 12-week intervals with dry macula
- **Recurrence rate at 12 months**: 52.9%
- **Mean time to recurrence**: 6.7 months
- **Early recurrence (≤8 months)**: 85.2%
- **Symptomatic recurrence**: Only 40.7%
- **Visual recovery after resuming**: Return to baseline in most cases

### Risk Factors for Recurrence
- Presence of PED: 74% recurrence rate
- No PED: 48% recurrence rate
- Previous recurrence: 65.5% risk
- No previous recurrence: 47.9% risk

## Early Response as Predictor (CATT Analysis)

### Week 12 Response Predictive Value
- **R² for Year 1 outcome**: 0.47
- **R² for Year 2 outcome**: 0.30
- **Key finding**: Week 12 response more predictive than baseline factors

### Poor Initial Responders (Switching Candidates)
- **Criteria**: VA ≤20/40, <1 line gain, persistent fluid
- **Outcome without switching**: +2.8 letters at Year 1
- **Fluid resolution**: 33% at Year 1
- **Implication**: Benefit from continued treatment without switching

## Clinical Implications for Parameter Calibration

### 1. Optimal Extension Strategy
- **Maximum effective interval**: 12-16 weeks
- **Conservative approach**: 12-week maximum (Maruko)
- **Aggressive approach**: 16-week maximum (ALTAIR)
- **Real-world achievement**: ~10 weeks average maximum

### 2. Vision-Injection Trade-offs
- **Fixed q8w**: Highest vision gains, predictable schedule
- **T&E**: Similar vision gains, fewer injections, requires monitoring
- **PRN**: Inferior vision outcomes, fewest injections

### 3. Discontinuation Considerations
- **High recurrence risk**: >50% within 12 months
- **Asymptomatic recurrence**: Common (60%)
- **Need for monitoring**: Critical even after discontinuation

### 4. Protocol Selection Factors
- **For maximum vision gain**: Fixed q8w or aggressive T&E
- **For reduced treatment burden**: T&E with careful extension
- **For resource constraints**: Conservative T&E (12-week maximum)

- T&E outcomes to 96 weeks (ALTAIR: n=246)
- Recurrence rates after discontinuation (n=102)
- Real-world T&E vs PRN comparison (n=3,313)

### Medium Confidence Parameters
- Disease state-specific responses
- Optimal extension criteria
- Long-term stability predictors

### Low Confidence Parameters
- Very long interval outcomes (>16 weeks)
- Switching benefit quantification
- Subgroup-specific interval optimization

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interval flexibility improves efficiency**: T&E achieves similar outcomes with fewer injections than fixed dosing
2. **Extension limits exist**: Most patients plateau at 12-16 week intervals
3. **Early response predicts success**: Patients extending early tend to maintain extensions
4. **Discontinuation risky**: >50% recurrence within 12 months
5. **Real-world gaps**: Clinical trial outcomes not fully replicated in practice
6. **Monitoring critical**: Even with extended intervals or after discontinuation
