## 2q8 Protocol Details

### Dosing Schedule
- **Loading Phase**: 3 initial monthly injections at weeks 0, 4, and 8
- **Maintenance Phase**: 2mg aflibercept every 8 weeks (every 2 months) after loading
- **Masking**: Sham injections given at interim 4-week visits to maintain blinding
- **Total Injections Year 1**: Average 7.5 active injections
- **Total Injections by Week 96**: 11.2 cumulative

## Visual Acuity Outcomes

### Primary Endpoint - Vision Maintenance (losing <15 ETDRS letters at Week 52)
- **VIEW 1**: 95.1% (252/265 patients, per protocol set)
- **VIEW 2**: 95.6% (258/270 patients, per protocol set)
- **Comparison**: Non-inferior to monthly ranibizumab (94.4% in both studies)

### Mean BCVA Change from Baseline at Week 52
- **VIEW 1**: +7.9 letters (SD ±15.0)
- **VIEW 2**: +8.9 letters (SD ±14.4)
- **Integrated Analysis**: Within 0.3 letters of monthly ranibizumab

### Proportion Gaining ≥15 Letters at Week 52
- **VIEW 1**: 30.6% (92/301 patients)
- **VIEW 2**: 31.4% (96/306 patients)

## Anatomic Outcomes

### Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) Change from Baseline
- **VIEW 1**: -128.5 μm (SD ±108.5)
- **VIEW 2**: -149.2 μm (SD ±119.7)

### Proportion with Dry Retina (no intraretinal/subretinal fluid on OCT)
- **VIEW 1**: 63.4% (168/265 patients)
- **VIEW 2**: 71.9% (197/274 patients)
- **Integrated Analysis**: 67.7%

### CNV Area Change from Baseline
- **VIEW 1**: -3.4 mm² (SD ±6.0)
- **VIEW 2**: -5.2 mm² (SD ±5.9)

### CRT Fluctuations
- Minor fluctuations observed between injections in VIEW 2
- Starting at 17 μm, decreasing to 8 μm over the year
- No apparent negative impact on visual acuity outcomes

## Baseline Patient Characteristics (2q8 arms)

### Visual Acuity
- **Mean Baseline BCVA**: 
  - VIEW 1: 55.7 ETDRS letters (SD ±12.8)
  - VIEW 2: 51.6 ETDRS letters (SD ±13.9)

### Anatomic Characteristics
- **Mean Baseline CRT**:
  - VIEW 1: 324.4 μm (SD ±111.2)
  - VIEW 2: 342.6 μm (SD ±124.0)
- **Mean CNV Area**:
  - VIEW 1: 6.57 mm² (SD ±5.1)
  - VIEW 2: 7.75 mm² (SD ±5.5)

### Lesion Type Distribution
- **Predominantly Classic**: ~24-29%
- **Minimally Classic**: ~35-36%
- **Occult**: ~36-39%

## Key Parameters for Model Calibration

### Treatment Protocol
1. Loading phase: 3 monthly injections (mandatory)
2. Maintenance: Q8 weeks (every 2 months)
3. Annual injection count: ~7.5 in Year 1

### Efficacy Benchmarks
1. Vision maintenance rate: 95.1-95.6%
2. Mean BCVA improvement: 7.9-8.9 letters
3. Significant gainers (≥15 letters): 30.6-31.4%

### Anatomic Benchmarks
1. CRT reduction: 128.5-149.2 μm
2. Dry retina achievement: 63.4-71.9%
3. Acceptable inter-injection CRT fluctuation: <17 μm

### Statistical Considerations
- Non-inferiority margin: 10% for primary endpoint
- Clinical equivalence margin: 5%
- All aflibercept 2q8 outcomes met both margins compared to monthly ranibizumab

## Notes for Simulation
- The 2q8 protocol achieved outcomes statistically non-inferior and clinically equivalent to monthly ranibizumab
- Despite fewer injections (7.5 vs ~12), visual outcomes were maintained
- Some anatomic fluctuation between injections is acceptable and doesn't impact visual outcomes
- Patient adherence was high (88.1-91.1% completion rate at 52 weeks)
