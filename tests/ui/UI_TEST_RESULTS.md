# UI Test Results - May 26, 2025

## Test Environment
- **App URL**: http://localhost:8503
- **App Title**: AMD Protocol Explorer (not APE V2)
- **Testing Method**: MCP Puppeteer

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Tests

1. **Homepage Loading**
   - App loads successfully
   - Title displays correctly
   - Navigation buttons visible

2. **Navigation**
   - Protocol Manager button works
   - Successfully navigates to /Protocol_Manager
   - Page content loads correctly

3. **Protocol Manager UI**
   - Protocol selector shows "eylea_treat_an..."
   - Upload, Duplicate, Download buttons present
   - "Next: Simulation" button is prominent
   - Home button with ape icon visible

4. **Button Styling (Partial Success)**
   - Most buttons have correct color: `rgb(38, 39, 48)`
   - No red text on main navigation buttons

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Red Button Text**
   - "Timing Parameters" button has red text: `rgb(255, 90, 95)`
   - This appears to be an expandable/collapsible section button
   - Our CSS fix may not be targeting these button types

2. **Playwright Tests**
   - Tests written but Playwright not installed
   - Need to install: `pip install playwright pytest-playwright`
   - Then: `playwright install chromium`

## Test Coverage Validation

The UI tests successfully verify:
- Page navigation works
- Session state (protocol selection persists)
- Button interactions
- Visual elements render correctly

## Next Steps

1. Fix the red button issue for expandable sections
2. Install Playwright for automated testing
3. Update tests to use port 8503 (or make configurable)
4. Run full automated test suite
