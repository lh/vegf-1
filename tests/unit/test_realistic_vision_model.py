"""Unit tests for the RealisticVisionModel.

This module contains tests to verify that the RealisticVisionModel
produces realistic and variable vision outcomes, including:
1. Natural vision decline over time
2. Vision fluctuations
3. Ceiling effects
4. Patient-specific response factors
5. Non-responder probability
6. Vision decline between injections
