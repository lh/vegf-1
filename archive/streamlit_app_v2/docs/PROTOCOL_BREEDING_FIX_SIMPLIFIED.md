# Protocol Breeding Fix - Simplified

## The Problem
- Protocols were "breeding" - multiplying rapidly in the dropdown
- Clicking duplicate created many copies instead of just one

## Root Cause
The duplicate dialog stayed open after creating a protocol, allowing rapid repeated clicks that created many duplicates.

## The Fix
1. **Removed complex deduplication** - Reverted to simple file listing
2. **Added success feedback** - Shows "âœ… Duplicate created successfully!" message outside the popover
3. **Force rerun after creation** - This refreshes the page and closes the popover

## Result
- Clicking "Create Duplicate" now creates exactly one copy
- The dialog closes automatically after success
- No more breeding protocols!

## Note
Each protocol still gets a timestamp suffix to ensure unique filenames, but this is expected behavior to prevent file conflicts.
