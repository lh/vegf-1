## Recommended V1 Implementation

### Must Have (Week 1)
```python
# Core components that everything depends on
1. SimulationData model with metadata
2. SimulationRegistry (basic dictionary)
3. SimulationStateService (load/save/get)
4. Basic memory limit (MAX_LOADED_SIMULATIONS)
5. Transactional updates for data integrity
```

### Should Have (Week 2)
```python
# High-value, low-risk enhancements
6. Two-tier loading (metadata vs full data)
7. Basic comparison support (2-way only)
8. Simple LRU eviction
9. Import/export with new structure
```

### Nice to Have (Week 3)
```python
# If time permits
10. Basic event bus (just for logging)
11. Performance timing (simple metrics)
12. Memory usage tracking
```

### Future Releases
```python
# V2 and beyond
- Full search and tagging
- Advanced comparison modes
- Persistent caching
- Schema migrations
- Multi-user coordination
```

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk Path
1. Implement core architecture only
2. Keep enhancements minimal
3. Focus on fixing current bugs
4. Add features incrementally

### Medium Risk Path
1. Include two-tier loading
2. Add basic event system
3. Implement comparison foundations
4. Some performance tracking

### High Risk Path
1. Implement all enhancements
2. Full rewrite in one go
3. Complex caching strategies
4. All advanced features

## Decision Criteria

### Choose Low Risk Path If:
- Need to ship quickly (< 2 weeks)
- Team is small
- Users need basic functionality NOW
- Can iterate later

### Choose Medium Risk Path If:
- Have 3-4 weeks
- Performance is becoming an issue
- Users requesting comparison features
- Want extensible architecture

### Choose High Risk Path If:
- Have 5+ weeks
- Building for enterprise
- Need all features from day 1
- Have dedicated QA resources

## Recommended Approach

**Start with Medium Risk Path** because:

1. **Addresses Real Pain Points**: Current state management is causing bugs
2. **Enables Key Feature**: Multi-simulation comparison is explicitly requested
3. **Future-Proof Design**: Two-tier loading prevents memory issues
4. **Reasonable Timeline**: 3-4 weeks is achievable
5. **Incremental Delivery**: Can ship working versions each week

## Implementation Checkpoints

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Core models defined and tested
- [ ] Basic registry working
- [ ] Can load/save simulations
- [ ] Old system still works (parallel)

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- [ ] Two-tier loading implemented
- [ ] Basic comparison working
- [ ] Memory management active
- [ ] Migration script ready

### Week 3 Checkpoint
- [ ] All pages migrated
- [ ] Import/export working
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Ready to remove old system

### Week 4 Checkpoint
- [ ] Old system removed

- [ ] Monitoring in place

## Success Metrics

### V1 Success = 
- Zero state synchronization bugs ✓
- Can compare 2 simulations ✓
- Memory usage < 2GB for 5 simulations ✓
- Page load time < 2 seconds ✓
- No data loss during migration ✓

### Future Success =
- Support 100+ simulations in registry
- Compare 5+ simulations simultaneously  
- Search results in < 100ms
- Memory usage scales linearly
- Zero downtime deployments
