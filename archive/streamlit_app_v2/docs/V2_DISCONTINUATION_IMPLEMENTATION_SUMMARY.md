# V2 Discontinuation Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-27

### What We Accomplished

1. **Implemented Comprehensive Discontinuation System**
   - Created `DiscontinuationProfile` class with YAML configuration support
   - Built `V2DiscontinuationManager` with priority-ordered evaluation
   - Extended `Patient` class with discontinuation tracking fields
   - Created `ABSEngineV2` integrating the discontinuation manager
   - Added two default profiles: "Ideal" (no system failures) and "NHS_1" (real-world UK parameters)

2. **Discontinuation Categories Implemented**
   - `stable_max_interval`: Patients reaching maximum stable interval
   - `system_discontinuation`: Random administrative issues (renamed from random_administrative)
   - `reauthorization_failure`: Funding lapses (renamed from course_complete_but_not_renewed)
   - `premature`: Patient-initiated stopping
   - `poor_response`: Based on <15 letter vision threshold (NICE guidance)
   - `mortality`: Annual rate of 20/1000

3. **Clinical Data Integration**
   - Based on Arendt, Aslanis, and Artiaga studies
   - Proper monitoring schedules for different discontinuation types
   - Retreatment logic with recurrence rates
   - Vision impact modeling (especially -9.4 letters for premature discontinuation)

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Created test script showing meaningful differences between profiles
   - Ideal profile: 91% discontinuation rate
   - NHS profile: 41.5% discontinuation rate
   - 2.8 letter vision difference between profiles
   - All 96 tests passing

5. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Updated `ParquetWriter` to capture new discontinuation fields
   - Fixed UI tests to use port 8509 (avoiding conflicts with development on 8501)
   - Removed obsolete carbon design system files and tests
   - Git commit completed with detailed message

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate System**: Discontinuation is a separate system on top of protocol management
2. **Priority Order**: Mortality → Poor Response → System → Reauthorization → Premature → Stable
3. **Profile-Based**: Users can create, edit, save and use various profiles
4. **YAML Configuration**: All parameters externalized for easy modification

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `/simulation_v2/core/discontinuation_profile.py`
- `/simulation_v2/core/discontinuation_manager.py`
- `/simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_v2.py`
- `/simulation_v2/profiles/discontinuation/ideal.yaml`
- `/simulation_v2/profiles/discontinuation/nhs_1.yaml`
- `/streamlit_app_v2/visualizations/streamgraph_enhanced.py`
- `/simulation_v2/test_v2_discontinuation.py`

**Modified:**
- `/simulation_v2/core/patient.py` - Added discontinuation tracking fields
- `/streamlit_app_v2/core/storage/writer.py` - Added new fields to patient summary
- `/streamlit_app_v2/tests/ui/conftest.py` - Changed test port to 8509
- `/streamlit_app_v2/tests/ui/test_streamlit_ui.py` - Updated for flexible testing

**Removed:**
- All carbon design system files in `/streamlit_app_v2/utils/carbon_*`
- Test pages for carbon design system

### Next Steps

1. **Update Streamgraph Visualization**: Currently only shows 3 states, needs to display all 6 discontinuation categories
2. **Integration with UI**: Add discontinuation profile selection to the Protocol Manager
3. **More Profiles**: Create additional profiles for different healthcare systems
4. **Documentation**: Add user documentation for the discontinuation system

### Git Status

- Commit completed: "feat: Implement comprehensive V2 discontinuation system with 6 categories"
- All tests passing (96 passed, 18 skipped)
- Ready to push once remaining visualization work is complete

### Note on Testing

Tests now use port 8509 to avoid conflicts with development server on 8501. The test framework will kill any existing process on 8509 before starting its own server.
