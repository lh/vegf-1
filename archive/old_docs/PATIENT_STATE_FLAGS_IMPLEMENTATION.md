# Patient State Flags Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the implementation of enhanced patient visit tracking in the simulation to support improved visualization of patient states in the streamgraph component. The changes provide explicit tracking of discontinuation and retreatment events directly in the visit records.

## Problem Statement

The streamgraph visualization requires specific flags in the patient visit records to properly track state transitions:

1. `is_discontinuation_visit` - Indicates when a patient discontinues treatment
2. `discontinuation_reason` - Records the type of discontinuation (stable_max_interval, random_administrative, etc.)
3. `is_retreatment` - Indicates when a previously discontinued patient returns to treatment
4. `retreatment_reason` - Records the original discontinuation type that led to this retreatment

These flags were missing in the simulation output, causing the streamgraph to improperly display patient states or requiring complex post-processing.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Enhanced Visit Records in PatientState

Modified the `_record_visit` method in `PatientState` class to add the required flags:

- Added logic to detect discontinuation events by:
  - Checking for "discontinue_treatment" in the actions list
  - Tracking state transitions from active to inactive treatment status
  - Recording discontinuation_reason from treatment_status

- Added logic to detect retreatment events by:
  - Tracking injections for previously discontinued patients
  - Identifying transitions from inactive to active treatment status
  - Finding and recording the original discontinuation reason

### 2. Propagation of Flags to ABS Visit Records

Modified the `process_event` method in the `AgentBasedSimulation` class to:

- Copy visualization-specific flags from PatientState visit records to ABS visit records
- Ensure treatment status information is consistently included
- Maintain compatibility with existing code

## Testing

Several test suites were created or modified to verify the implementation:

1. `test_patient_state_flags.py` - Tests that the PatientState class correctly adds the required flags
2. `test_patient_state_visit_records.py` - Updated to verify the presence of the flags
3. `test_abs_visit_history.py` - Tests ABS visit record structure
4. `test_treat_and_extend_abs_discontinuation.py` - Tests discontinuation handling in TreatAndExtendABS
5. `test_visualization_data_requirements.py` - Integration test for visualization data requirements

## Benefits

This implementation:

1. Fixes the issue directly at the source by enhancing the simulation output
2. Avoids the need for complex post-processing adapters
3. Maintains data integrity through the entire simulation-to-visualization pipeline
4. Makes the visualization more reliable by providing explicit flags
5. Improves maintainability by following the principle of addressing issues at their source

## Future Considerations

1. This implementation may be further optimized for performance if needed
2. Additional flags could be added for other state transitions using the same pattern
3. The approach could be extended to other simulation types beyond ABS

## Verification

All unit tests and integration tests pass, confirming that the implementation successfully adds the required flags while maintaining compatibility with existing code.
