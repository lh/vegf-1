# Fixed Streamgraph Implementation

This document explains the fix for the streamgraph time issue in the visualization code.

## Problem

The original implementation of the streamgraph visualization had issues with time handling when dealing with date strings or nanosecond timestamps. The main problems were:

1. Inconsistent date format handling between different data sources
2. Incorrect conversion from timestamps to month values
3. Failure to properly track state transitions over time

## Solution

The solution involved two main components:

1. A more robust date parsing system that can handle multiple formats (strings, timestamps, datetime objects)
2. A consistent approach to tracking patient state transitions across time

The key improvements were:

- Better detection of date formats in the input data
- Proper conversion of strings/timestamps to datetime objects
- Consistent calculation of months from the start date
- Improved tracking and visualization of patient state transitions

## Implementation

The fixed implementation is available in two forms:

1. `streamlit_app/streamgraph_patient_states_fixed.py` - A complete replacement for the original module
2. `fix_date_format.py` - A standalone script that demonstrates the core date handling fixes

## Testing

The fixed implementation was tested with actual simulation data from `full_streamgraph_test_data.json`.

The visualization now correctly shows:

- Active patients (green)
- Discontinued patients by reason:
  - Planned discontinuation (amber)
  - Administrative discontinuation (red)
  - Course complete discontinuation (dark red)
  - Premature discontinuation (darkest red)

## Recommendations

1. Replace the existing `streamgraph_patient_states.py` with the fixed version
2. Use the more robust date handling approach for other visualizations
3. Add additional unit tests to verify date handling with different formats

## Notes

- The CLAUDE.md file contains important instructions about visualization standards
- Date handling is a critical aspect of the system and should be properly documented
