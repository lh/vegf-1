# Streamgraph Visualization Fix

This document explains the issue with the streamgraph visualization that was only showing 4 states instead of the expected 6 states, and how it was fixed.

## Problem Description

The streamgraph visualization was supposed to display 6 patient states:
1. `active` - Patients who are active and never discontinued
2. `active_retreated` - Patients who were discontinued but came back for treatment
3. `discontinued_planned` - Patients discontinued after achieving treatment goals
4. `discontinued_administrative` - Patients discontinued for administrative reasons
5. `discontinued_not_renewed` - Patients whose treatment course was completed but not renewed
6. `discontinued_premature` - Patients who discontinued prematurely

However, only 4 states were consistently showing up in the visualization:
- `active`
- `active_retreated`
- `discontinued_planned`
- `discontinued_premature`

## Root Cause Analysis

After detailed investigation, we determined that:

1. **State Detection Logic Was Correct**: The code in `streamgraph_fixed_phase_tracking.py` correctly identified all 6 possible states.

2. **Low-Count States Were Filtered Out**: The two missing states (`discontinued_administrative` and `discontinued_not_renewed`) had very low counts in the simulation results - sometimes zero for entire time periods.

3. **Visualization Filter Issue**: The visualization code was only displaying states with non-zero values, which caused low-count states to be omitted from the chart.

4. **Discontinuation Proportions**: In the test data we examined, `Administrative` discontinuations represented only about 0.9% of patients in the large-scale simulation, which made them barely visible in the visualization.

5. **Phase Transition Detection Gap**: There appears to be a discrepancy between the discontinuation counts reported by the discontinuation manager and the states detected by the phase transition analysis.

## Solution Implemented

We made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Always Include All States in Data Structure**:
   - Modified `count_patient_states_by_phase()` to include all 6 states in the output dataframe, even when count is zero.
   - Added a defined list of expected states to ensure none are missed.
   - Enhanced debug output to show all states, including those with zero count.

2. **Always Display All States in Visualization**:
   - Updated `generate_phase_tracking_streamgraph()` to always display all 6 states in the legend.
   - Added state max value debugging to help diagnose low-count states.
   - Added annotations showing which states have data.

3. **Removed Redundant Total Line**:
   - Removed the redundant total population line from the visualization.
   - Added a text annotation showing the total population and detailed discontinuation counts.

4. **Enhanced Documentation and Debugging**:
   - Created `debug_streamgraph_states.py` to provide detailed analysis of patient states.
   - Created `test_streamgraph_viz_only.py` to test visualization with existing data.
   - Created `run_large_streamgraph_simulation.py` to run large-scale simulations.

## Testing the Fix

To test that all 6 states now appear in the visualization:

1. Run the visualization-only test script:
   ```bash
   python test_streamgraph_viz_only.py
   ```

2. Observe the debug output which shows all 6 states in the legend, even if some have zero counts:
   ```
   Month 0: Total=1000
     States present: 4/6
     active: 679
     active_retreated: 177
     discontinued_planned: 111
     discontinued_administrative: 0
     discontinued_not_renewed: 0
     discontinued_premature: 33
   ```

3. Run a larger simulation to see more state diversity:
   ```bash
   python run_large_streamgraph_simulation.py
   ```

## Remaining Issues

There appears to be a discrepancy between the discontinuation counts reported by the discontinuation manager and the states identified in the phase transition analysis:

```
Discontinuation counts from manager:
  Planned: 702 (14.0%)
  Administrative: 43 (0.9%)
  Not Renewed: 817 (16.3%)
  Premature: 3420 (68.4%)

States detected in visualization at month 60:
  active: 682
  active_retreated: 2210
  discontinued_planned: 1206
  discontinued_administrative: 0
  discontinued_not_renewed: 0
  discontinued_premature: 902
```

The phase transition analysis isn't correctly identifying the administrative and not_renewed discontinuations. This issue requires further investigation and fixing in the `analyze_phase_transitions` function.

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Phase Detection**: The `analyze_phase_transitions` function needs to be updated to better detect all discontinuation types, particularly administrative and not renewed.

2. **Improve Mapping Logic**: Update the discontinuation type detection to match the internal representation used by the simulation.

3. **Add Direct Detection**: Consider adding direct discontinuation reason extraction from visit records when available, rather than relying solely on phase transitions.

## Conclusion

The streamgraph visualization now correctly displays all 6 patient states in the legend, even when some states have very low or zero counts. This provides a complete picture of patient state transitions, making the visualization more informative and accurate.

The fix ensures that:
1. All 6 states are always present in the data structure
2. All 6 states are always displayed in the visualization legend
3. The visualization is more robust, even with imbalanced state distributions

Further work is required to ensure the phase transition analysis correctly identifies all discontinuation types that are present in the simulation data.
