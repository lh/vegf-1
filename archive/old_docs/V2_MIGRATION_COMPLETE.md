# 🎉 V2 Migration Complete!

## Summary

The AMD Treatment Simulation Platform V2 is now the main development branch.

### What We Accomplished

1. **Built V2 from scratch** using test-driven development
2. **Created advanced visualization system**:
   - Dual modes (Analysis/Presentation)
   - ChartBuilder pattern
   - StyleConstants for consistency
   - Clean time axes (0, 3, 6, 9... months)
3. **Implemented protocol specification system** with no hardcoded parameters
4. **Mothballed V1** with clear deprecation notices
5. **Successfully merged to main**

```

### Next Steps

Create new feature branches from main for:
- Parquet integration for large simulations
- Batch simulation runners
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Protocol comparison tools
- Enhanced reporting

### Running V2

```bash
cd streamlit_app_v2
streamlit run app.py
```
