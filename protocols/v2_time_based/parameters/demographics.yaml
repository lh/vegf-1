# Gender distribution by age group in wet AMD population
# Values represent proportion of females (0.0 to 1.0)
gender_distribution_by_age:
  # Age ranges with corresponding female proportion
  50-59: 0.48    # Slight male predominance in early AMD
  60-64: 0.50    # Equal distribution
  65-69: 0.52    # Beginning of female shift
  70-74: 0.54    # Moderate female predominance
  75-79: 0.57    # Increasing female predominance
  80-84: 0.62    # Strong female predominance
  85-89: 0.67    # Very strong female predominance
  90-94: 0.72    # Extreme female predominance
  95+: 0.75      # Maximum female predominance

# Smooth function parameters for continuous age modeling
# Female proportion = base + (max - base) * sigmoid((age - midpoint) / scale)
gender_distribution_function:
  base_female_proportion: 0.48  # Proportion at younger ages
  max_female_proportion: 0.75   # Maximum proportion at oldest ages
  midpoint_age: 75             # Age where steepest change occurs
  scale_factor: 10              # Controls steepness of transition

# Population distribution by age (relative weights)
# Based on UK AMD prevalence and population structure

# Treatment access modifiers by age and gender
# Accounts for differential healthcare access/utilization
treatment_access_modifiers:
  male:
    50-64: 1.00   # Full access
    65-74: 0.98   # Slight reduction
    75-84: 0.95   # Moderate reduction
    85+: 0.90     # Significant reduction
  female:
    50-64: 1.00   # Full access
    65-74: 1.00   # Better healthcare engagement
    75-84: 0.98   # Minimal reduction
    85+: 0.95     # Less reduction than males

# Survival bias factors
# Accounts for healthier survivors at older ages
survival_bias_factors:
  # Reduction in excess mortality risk for "super survivors"
  80-84: 0.95   # 5% reduction in excess risk
  85-89: 0.90   # 10% reduction
  90-94: 0.85   # 15% reduction
  95+: 0.80     # 20% reduction

# Clinical trial vs real-world adjustments
population_type_adjustments:
  clinical_trial:

    age_shift: -3.0  # Years younger on average
    female_proportion_adjustment: -0.05  # Fewer females
