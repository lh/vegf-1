# Disease State Transition Parameters for Time-Based Model
# All probabilities are per fortnight (14 days)

# Fortnightly transition probabilities
# Calibrated from clinical data on annual progression rates
fortnightly_transitions:
  NAIVE:
    # New patients typically progress quickly without treatment
    NAIVE: 0.00          # Cannot stay naive
    STABLE: 0.30         # 30% chance to stabilize
    ACTIVE: 0.60         # 60% chance to be active
    HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.10  # 10% chance of severe disease
  
  STABLE:
    # Stable patients have slow progression
    NAIVE: 0.00          # Cannot go back to naive
    STABLE: 0.975        # 97.5% stay stable per fortnight (~15% annual progression)
    ACTIVE: 0.025        # 2.5% progress per fortnight
    HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.00  # Should not jump directly to highly active
  
  ACTIVE:
    # Active disease has moderate progression risk
    NAIVE: 0.00          # Cannot go back to naive
    STABLE: 0.05         # 5% chance to stabilize (with treatment)
    ACTIVE: 0.90         # 90% stay active
    HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.05  # 5% worsen per fortnight
  
  HIGHLY_ACTIVE:
    # Severe disease rarely improves without treatment
    NAIVE: 0.00          # Cannot go back to naive
    STABLE: 0.01         # 1% chance of dramatic improvement
    ACTIVE: 0.04         # 4% chance to improve
    HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.95  # 95% stay highly active

# Validation targets (annual rates for calibration)
validation_targets:
  STABLE_annual_progression: 0.15    # ~15% progress from stable per year
  ACTIVE_annual_worsening: 0.50      # ~50% worsen from active per year
  HIGHLY_ACTIVE_improvement: 0.20    # ~20% improve with treatment per year
