# Treatment Effect Parameters for Time-Based Model

# Treatment efficacy decay parameters
treatment_decay:
  # Full effect duration (days)
  full_effect_duration_days: 56      # 8 weeks
  
  # Half-life for exponential decay after full effect period
  half_life_days: 56                 # Effect drops to 50% at 16 weeks
  
  # Minimum residual effect
  minimum_effect: 0.0                # No effect after long periods

# Treatment effect multipliers by disease state
# These modify transition probabilities when treatment is effective
treatment_multipliers:
  STABLE:
    multipliers:
      STABLE: 1.1      # 10% more likely to stay stable
      ACTIVE: 0.9      # 10% less likely to progress
      HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.0  # Should not transition directly
  
  ACTIVE:
    multipliers:
      STABLE: 2.0      # 2x more likely to improve to stable
      ACTIVE: 0.8      # 20% less likely to stay active
      HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.5  # 50% less likely to worsen
  
  HIGHLY_ACTIVE:
    multipliers:
      STABLE: 2.0      # 2x more likely to improve dramatically
      ACTIVE: 1.5      # 50% more likely to improve to active
      HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 0.75  # 25% less likely to stay highly active

# Treatment response modifiers
treatment_response:
  # Probability of being a treatment responder
  responder_probability: 0.7   # 70% of patients respond to treatment
  
  # Non-responder effect reduction
  non_responder_effect: 0.3    # Non-responders get 30% of effect
