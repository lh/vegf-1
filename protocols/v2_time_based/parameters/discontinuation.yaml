# Discontinuation Parameters for Time-Based Model
# All checks happen at visits only

discontinuation_parameters:
  # 1. Death - natural mortality
  death:
    base_annual_mortality: 0.02        # 2% per year base rate
    age_adjustment_per_decade: 1.5     # 50% increase per decade over 70
    disease_mortality_multiplier:
      STABLE: 1.0
      ACTIVE: 1.1
      HIGHLY_ACTIVE: 1.2
  
  # 2. Attrition - loss to follow-up
  attrition:
    base_probability_per_visit: 0.01   # 1% per visit baseline
    
    # Time-based adjustments
    time_adjustment:
      months_0_12: 1.0     # First year
      months_12_24: 1.2    # Second year - 20% higher
      months_24_plus: 1.5  # After 2 years - 50% higher
    
    # Treatment burden adjustments
    injection_burden_adjustment:
      injections_per_year_0_6: 1.0    # Low burden
      injections_per_year_6_12: 1.2   # Medium burden
      injections_per_year_12_plus: 1.5  # High burden
  
  # 3. Administrative error
  administrative:
    probability_per_visit: 0.005  # 0.5% constant rate
  
  # 4. Treatment decision (clinical judgment)
  treatment_decision:
    # Stop if stable too long
    stable_disease_visits_threshold: 6      # After 6 consecutive stable visits
    stable_discontinuation_probability: 0.2 # 20% chance to stop
    
    # Stop if no improvement
    no_improvement_visits_threshold: 4      # After 4 visits without improvement
    no_improvement_probability: 0.15        # 15% chance to stop
    
    # Minimum treatments before considering
    min_treatments_before_decision: 3
  
  # 5. Continued deterioration
  deterioration:
    vision_loss_threshold: -10        # Lost 10+ letters from baseline
    visits_with_loss_threshold: 3     # Over 3 consecutive visits
    discontinuation_probability: 0.7  # 70% chance to stop
  
  # 6. Poor vision (vision floor)
  poor_vision:
    vision_threshold: 20              # Below 20 letters
    discontinuation_probability: 0.8  # 80% chance
    grace_period_visits: 2           # Allow 2 visits below threshold
    
    # Alternative thresholds (for sensitivity analysis)
    alternative_thresholds:
      conservative: 10   # More aggressive treatment
      standard: 20       # Current guidelines
      restrictive: 25    # Earlier stopping

# Priority order for discontinuation reasons
# First matching reason is recorded
discontinuation_priority:
  1: death
  2: poor_vision      # Clinical priority
  3: deterioration    # Clinical judgment
  4: treatment_decision
  5: attrition
  6: administrative
