  # Criteria for discontinuation
  criteria:
    # Discontinuation after stable visits at maximum interval
    stable_max_interval:
      consecutive_visits: 3  # Number of consecutive stable visits required
      probability: 0.2       # Probability of discontinuation when criteria met
    
    # Random administrative discontinuations (e.g., insurance issues, patient choice)
    random_administrative:
      annual_probability: 0.05  # Annual probability of random discontinuation
    
    # Time-based discontinuation (e.g., after 1 year of treatment)
    treatment_duration:
      threshold_weeks: 52    # Weeks of treatment before considering discontinuation
      probability: 0.1       # Probability of discontinuation after threshold
  
  # Post-discontinuation monitoring
  monitoring:
    follow_up_schedule: [12, 24, 36]  # Weeks after discontinuation for follow-up visits
    recurrence_detection_probability: 0.87  # Probability of detecting recurrence if present
  
  # Treatment re-entry criteria
  retreatment:
    eligibility_criteria:
      detected_fluid: true           # Fluid must be detected
      vision_loss_letters: 5         # Minimum vision loss to trigger retreatment
    probability: 0.95                # Probability of retreatment when eligible
