# Visit Type Definitions
#
# This file defines standard visit types used in ophthalmic treatment protocols.
# Each visit type specifies:
#   - actions: Clinical procedures performed during the visit
#   - decisions: Clinical decisions made during/after the visit
#
# Standard Actions:
#   - vision_test: Standard ETDRS vision test (0-85 letters)
#   - oct_scan: Optical coherence tomography imaging
#   - injection: Anti-VEGF intravitreal injection
#
# Standard Decisions:
#   - nurse_vision_check: Nurse reviews vision results
#   - doctor_oct_review: Doctor reviews OCT scan
#   - doctor_treatment_decision: Doctor makes treatment decisions
#
# Visit types are referenced by:
#   - Simulation engine (process_visit method)
#   - Protocol definitions
#   - Outcome analysis
#
# Notes:
# - Visit types can be extended by adding new entries
# - Actions/decisions must match expected values in simulation code
# - Changes here may require updates to clinical workflow logic
