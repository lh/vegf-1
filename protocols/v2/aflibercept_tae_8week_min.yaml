# Protocol type - treat and extend
protocol_type: "treat_and_extend"

# T&E intervals - NHS constraint of 8-week minimum
min_interval_days: 56      # 8 weeks (NHS minimum)
max_interval_days: 112     # 16 weeks maximum
extension_days: 14         # Extend by 2 weeks if stable
shortening_days: 14        # Shorten by 2 weeks if active

# Loading phase - standard 3 monthly doses

  enabled: true
  doses: 3
  interval_days: 28  # Monthly during loading

# Import base configuration from Python module
# This ensures identical disease model and vision parameters with T&T protocol

# Protocol-specific overrides (minimal - most comes from base)
# Only override what's specific to T&E behavior

# Response heterogeneity specific to T&E
# 60% optimal responders (can extend), 40% suboptimal (shorter intervals)

  # T&E-specific response distribution (from cost calculator)
  response_types:
    good:
      probability: 0.60    # 60% optimal responders who can extend
      multiplier: 1.8      # Better vision gains
    average:
      probability: 0.30    # 30% moderate responders
      multiplier: 1.0      # Normal vision gains
    poor:
      probability: 0.10    # 10% poor responders
      multiplier: 0.5      # Reduced vision gains

# Target outcomes for validation
target_outcomes:
  year1:
    mean_bcva_change: 6.0    # 5-6 letters expected
    mean_injections: 7.5     # 7-8 injections
  year2:
    mean_bcva_change: 5.0    # Slight decline from peak
    cumulative_injections: 12.5  # ~5 in year 2

# Notes for implementation:
# - Uses shared base configuration from base_configs.py
# - T&E decisions based on disease state at previous visit
# - Responder types affect ability to extend intervals
# - Good responders more likely to achieve longer intervals
