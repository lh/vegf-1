# Aflibercept Treat-and-Treat Protocol (Fixed q8w)
# VIEW protocol extended indefinitely - uses shared base configuration

description: "Fixed 8-week dosing (VIEW 2q8 extended indefinitely) with minimal monitoring"

# Protocol type - fixed interval dosing
protocol_type: "fixed_interval"

# Fixed intervals - no adaptation
min_interval_days: 56      # 8 weeks always
max_interval_days: 56      # 8 weeks always
extension_days: 0          # No extension (fixed protocol)
shortening_days: 0         # No shortening (fixed protocol)

# Loading phase - standard 3 monthly doses (identical to T&E)
loading_phase:
  enabled: true
  doses: 3
  interval_days: 28  # Monthly during loading (weeks 0, 4, 8)

# Import base configuration from Python module
# This ensures identical disease model and vision parameters with T&E protocol
import_base_config: true
base_config_module: "simulation_v2.protocols.base_configs"
base_config_name: "aflibercept"

# Protocol-specific overrides
# T&T has same patient mix but no interval adaptation

# Clinical improvements - same as base but emphasize fixed nature
clinical_improvements:
  enabled: true
  use_loading_phase: true
  use_time_based_discontinuation: true
  use_response_based_vision: true

  # Same response distribution as base (VIEW-like)
  # But response type doesn't affect intervals (fixed protocol)
  response_types:
    good:
      probability: 0.30    # 30% good responders
      multiplier: 1.8      # Better vision gains
    average:
      probability: 0.50    # 50% average responders
      multiplier: 1.0      # Normal vision gains
    poor:
      probability: 0.20    # 20% poor responders
      multiplier: 0.5      # Reduced vision gains

# Minimal monitoring assumption for T&T
# Less frequent OCT, mainly safety checks
monitoring:
  oct_frequency: "quarterly"  # vs monthly for T&E
  safety_visits_only: false   # Still full visits but less imaging

# Target outcomes for validation
target_outcomes:
  year1:
    mean_bcva_change: 7.5    # 7-8 letters expected (better than T&E)
    mean_injections: 7.5     # Fixed 7.5 injections
  year2:
    mean_bcva_change: 7.0    # Maintained efficacy
    cumulative_injections: 13.5  # 6 more in year 2

# Notes for implementation:
# - Uses shared base configuration from base_configs.py
# - No treatment adaptation - always treat at 8 weeks
# - Same patient population as T&E for fair comparison
# - Patients on q8w schedule should have identical outcomes in both protocols
