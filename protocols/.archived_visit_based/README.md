# Archived Visit-Based Protocols

This directory contains the original visit-based protocol definitions that have been superseded by time-based protocols.

## Why Archived?

- Visit-based protocols didn't accurately model the underlying disease progression
- Time-based protocols better represent the continuous nature of AMD progression
- All new development focuses on time-based protocols with resource tracking

## Contents

These are the original v2 visit-based protocol definitions. They are kept for reference but should not be used for new simulations.

## Migration

To use these protocols again:
1. Copy the desired protocol to `protocols/v2/`
2. Consider converting it to a time-based protocol instead

## Note

As of 2025-01-24, all active development uses time-based protocols (in `protocols/v2_time_based/`).
