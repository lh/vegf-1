    Based on UK real-world data (n=2,029):
    - Natural disease follows Beta(3.5, 2.0) distribution
    - NICE funding threshold at 70 letters creates selection effect
    - 60% reduction in density above 70 letters
    - Results in ~20.4% of patients measuring >70 at treatment start
    - Mean: 58.36, Median: 62, Std: 15.12

  data_source: Real-world Eylea patient data (n=1,775, 2007-2025)
  notes:
  - Based on 7.8 deaths per 100 patient-years
  - 'Average age at death: 89.5 years'
  - Treatment gaps significantly increase mortality risk
# Change notes for v1.1:
# - Added beta distribution with threshold effect for baseline vision
# - Based on analysis of 2,029 UK real-world patients
# - Captures both biological disease distribution and healthcare system effects
# - Mean baseline vision now 58.36 instead of 70 (more realistic)
