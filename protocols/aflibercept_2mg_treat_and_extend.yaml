clinical_evidence:
  source: "Based on best available knowledge and current clinical practice"
  key_principles:
    - "First choice: Aflibercept 2mg (switch to biosimilar when available)"
    - "Maximum 3 lines of therapy per eye"
    - "Switch if unable to extend beyond 7 weeks after 2 attempts"
  limitations:
    - "Loading phase assumed as 3 monthly doses (standard practice)"
    - "Disease state transitions calibrated from existing project data"
    - "Vision change parameters based on project's eylea parameter sets"
    - "May require fine-tuning based on specific aflibercept 2mg trial data"
