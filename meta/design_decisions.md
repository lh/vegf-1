# Design Decisions

1. **YAML Structure**: Using nested YAML structure for protocols to balance human readability with machine parsing needs
2. **Condition System**: Simple key/value conditions with comparators for treatment decisions
3. **Temporal Logic**: Using interval/week-based scheduling for injections and assessments
4. **Agent-Based**: Protocol steps designed to work with both individual patient agents and population-level simulations
