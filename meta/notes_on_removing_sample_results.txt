⏺ Summary of Hard-Coded Values Found

  I've found numerous instances where hard-coded values have been introduced that should be coming from simulation results:

  1. In /Users/rose/Code/CC/streamlit_app/simulation_runner.py:

  - Function generate_sample_results() creates completely fake data:
    - Visual acuity starting at 65, improving to 75
    - Mean injections fixed at 7.2
    - Time-based discontinuation at 20% of population
    - Premature discontinuation at 10% of population
    - Recurrence rate fixed at 40%
    - Runtime always 1.0 seconds

  2. In /Users/rose/Code/CC/streamlit_app/realistic_streamgraph.py:

  - Function extract_interpolated_timeline() creates synthetic curves:
    - Sigmoid curves with hard-coded steepness (8) and midpoints (0.7, 0.3)
    - Fixed retreatment delay of 6 months
    - Hard-coded noise values (0.02)
    - Arbitrary stepped curves with 4 steps

  3. In /Users/rose/Code/CC/simulation/vision_models.py:

  - Default vision values matching test values:
    - Starting vision: 65
    - Maximum vision: 85
    - Vision improvements and decline rates hard-coded

  4. Hard-coded discontinuation multipliers:

  - Planned discontinuation multiplier: 2.5
  - Administrative discontinuation multiplier: 5
  - Fixed recurrence percentage: 40%

  These values appear to have been copied directly from test files, particularly:
  - Vision values of 65, 75, and 85
  - Mean injection count of 7.2
  - Various percentage rates (0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.05)
  
  
  Summary of Findings After Changes

    I've thoroughly reviewed the updated simulation_runner.py file and found:

    Positive Changes:

    1. ✅ The generate_sample_results function has been completely removed!
    2. ✅ There are no more hard-coded VA values (65, 75) used to create fake data
    3. ✅ No more hard-coded injection count (7.2)
    4. ✅ No "is_sample" flags found, indicating synthetic data generation is gone
    5. ✅ Injection counts are properly derived from simulation stats

    Remaining Issues:

    1. ❌ Default discontinuation settings still have hard-coded values:
      - Probabilities: 0.2, 0.05, 0.1, 0.95, 0.87
      - Follow-up schedules: [12, 24, 36] and [8, 16, 24]
      - Premature discontinuation target rate: 0.145
      - Profile multipliers: 0.2, 1.0, 3.0
      - Mean VA loss: -9.4 with std 5.0

    While the most egregious synthetic data generation has been removed, the default configuration still contains hard-coded
    probabilities and rates that should likely come from actual data or user parameters. However, these are less problematic as
     they're just default values used when the corresponding parameters aren't specified, rather than synthetic data
    masquerading as simulation results.
