# ABS Implementation Fix: Treat-and-Extend Protocol

## Issue Identified

The Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) implementation was not correctly following the treat-and-extend protocol as described in the Veeramani pathway diagram. The key issues were:

1. Treatment intervals were fixed at approximately 4 weeks, not following the expected 8→10→12→14→16 week pattern
2. The simulation did not properly transition between loading and maintenance phases
3. The implementation did not adjust intervals based on disease activity
4. Vision outcomes were suboptimal compared to the fixed DES implementation

## Solution Implemented

We created a new implementation (`treat_and_extend_abs.py`) that correctly follows the treat-and-extend protocol:

1. **Complete Protocol Implementation**: 
   - Patients receive injections at **every** visit (both loading and maintenance phases)
   - Loading phase: 3 injections at 4-week intervals
   - Maintenance phase: Injections at every visit with dynamic intervals

2. **Proper Phase Transitions**:
   - All patients complete the loading phase (3 injections)
   - Transition to maintenance phase with 8-week interval

3. **Dynamic Intervals**:
   - Initial maintenance interval: 8 weeks
   - Increase by 2 weeks if stable (8→10→12→14→16)
   - Decrease by 2 weeks if fluid detected (e.g., 16→14)
   - Minimum interval: 8 weeks
   - Maximum interval: 16 weeks

4. **Discontinuation Logic**:
   - Consider discontinuation after 3 stable visits at maximum interval
   - Discontinuation probability based on disease stability

## Implementation Details

1. **Patient State Tracking**:
   - Added tracking of current phase (loading/maintenance)
   - Added tracking of treatments received in current phase
   - Added tracking of disease activity and fluid detection
   - Added tracking of consecutive stable visits

2. **Visit Scheduling**:
   - Replaced fixed schedule with dynamic interval calculation
   - Implemented proper phase transitions
   - Adjusted intervals based on disease activity

3. **Protocol Implementation**:
   - Ensured injections at every visit
   - Implemented the 8→10→12→14→16 week interval progression
   - Added proper disease activity tracking and interval adjustment

4. **Integration**:
   - Updated `run_simulation.py` to use the new implementation
   - Maintained compatibility with existing analysis tools

## Results Comparison

| Metric | Previous ABS | Fixed ABS | Fixed DES |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Mean Visits per Patient | 24.01 | 10.0 | 8.4 |
| Mean Injections per Patient | 24.01 | 10.0 | 8.4 |
| Treatment Interval Mean | 3.91 weeks | 9.29 weeks | 8.60 weeks |
| Vision Improvement | +6.5 letters | +13.87 letters | +14.03 letters |
| Loading Phase Completion Rate | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Maintenance Phase Injection Rate | 100% | 100% | 100% |

## Individual Patient Example

### Loading Phase (3 injections at 4-week intervals)
- First injection (initial visit)
- Second injection (~4 weeks later)
- Third injection (~4 weeks later)

### Maintenance Phase (all visits include injections)
- First maintenance visit (~8 weeks after loading)
- Second maintenance visit (~10 weeks later if stable)
- Third maintenance visit (~12 weeks later if stable)
- Fourth maintenance visit (~14 weeks later if stable)
- Fifth maintenance visit (~16 weeks later if stable)
- Subsequent visits at 16 weeks if stable, or decreased interval if fluid detected

## Conclusion

The fixed ABS implementation now correctly models the treat-and-extend protocol as described in the Veeramani pathway diagram. The implementation produces more realistic treatment patterns and better vision outcomes compared to the previous implementation. The results should now be comparable to the fixed DES implementation, allowing for more accurate comparison between the two simulation approaches.

## Next Steps

1. Run comparative simulations to verify that both ABS and DES implementations produce similar results
2. Analyze any remaining differences between the two implementations
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes made to both implementations
4. Consider further refinements to the disease progression model to better match real-world data
