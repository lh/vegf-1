# Beta Distribution Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a flexible baseline vision distribution system that allows protocols to use different statistical distributions for modeling patient baseline vision, with special support for UK real-world data using a beta distribution with threshold effect.

## Key Features

### 1. Distribution Types
- **Normal Distribution**: Standard clinical trial distribution (default)
- **Beta with Threshold**: Models UK real-world data with NICE funding threshold effect
- **Uniform Distribution**: For testing purposes

### 2. Beta Distribution with Threshold Effect
- Based on analysis of 2,029 UK patients
- Captures the bimodal nature of real-world data
- Models the NICE funding threshold effect at 70 letters
- Parameters:
  - Alpha (α): 3.5 (shape parameter)
  - Beta (β): 2.0 (shape parameter)  
  - Threshold: 70 letters (NICE funding cutoff)
  - Reduction: 60% (reduction in probability above threshold)
  - Results in ~58.4 mean, ~20.4% > 70 letters (matching UK data)

### 3. UI Enhancements
- Distribution type selector in Protocol Manager
- Live preview of distribution while editing parameters
- Visual graph display in both edit and read-only modes
- Properly scoped to Population tab only
- Support for both standard and time-based protocols

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Factory pattern for creating distributions
- Backward compatible - existing protocols continue to work
- Optional `baseline_vision_distribution` field in protocol YAML
- Integrated with both ABS and DES engines

## Files Modified

### Core Distribution System
- `simulation_v2/models/baseline_vision_distributions.py` - Distribution classes and factory
- `simulation_v2/protocols/protocol_spec.py` - Added distribution field to protocol spec
- `simulation_v2/protocols/time_based_protocol_spec.py` - Added distribution field for time-based
- `simulation_v2/core/simulation_runner.py` - Create distribution from protocol spec
- `simulation_v2/core/time_based_simulation_runner.py` - Support for time-based protocols

### Engine Integration  
- `simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine.py` - Accept distribution parameter
- `simulation_v2/engines/des_engine.py` - Accept distribution parameter
- `simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_time_based.py` - Time-based support
- `simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_time_based_with_specs.py` - Time-based with specs

### UI Updates
- `pages/1_Protocol_Manager.py` - Distribution editor and live preview

## Usage Example

```yaml
# In protocol YAML file
baseline_vision_distribution:
  type: beta_with_threshold
  alpha: 3.5
  beta: 2.0
  min: 5
  max: 98
  threshold: 70
  threshold_reduction: 0.6
```

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Creating new protocols with different distributions
- Editing existing protocols
- Duplicating protocols
- Running simulations with beta distribution
- Verifying the distribution statistics match UK data

## Next Steps
The beta distribution system is ready for production use and can model real-world patient populations more accurately than the standard normal distribution.
