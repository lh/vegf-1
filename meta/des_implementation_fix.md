# DES Implementation Fix: Treat-and-Extend Protocol

## Issue Identified

The Discrete Event Simulation (DES) implementation was not correctly following the treat-and-extend protocol as described in the Veeramani pathway diagram. The key issues were:

1. Patients were not receiving injections during the maintenance phase
2. Loading phase completion rate was only 66.8%
3. Treatment intervals were not following the expected 8→10→12→14→16 week pattern
4. Vision outcomes were suboptimal (+4.2 letters vs. expected +14-15 letters)

## Solution Implemented

We created a new implementation (`treat_and_extend_des.py`) that correctly follows the treat-and-extend protocol:

1. **Complete Protocol Implementation**: 
   - Patients receive injections at **every** visit (both loading and maintenance phases)
   - Loading phase: 3 injections at 4-week intervals
   - Maintenance phase: Injections at every visit with dynamic intervals

2. **Proper Phase Transitions**:
   - All patients complete the loading phase (3 injections)
   - Transition to maintenance phase with 8-week interval

3. **Dynamic Intervals**:
   - Initial maintenance interval: 8 weeks
   - Increase by 2 weeks if stable (8→10→12→14→16)
   - Decrease by 2 weeks if fluid detected (e.g., 16→14)
   - Minimum interval: 8 weeks
   - Maximum interval: 16 weeks

4. **Discontinuation Logic**:
   - Consider discontinuation after 3 stable visits at maximum interval
   - 20% chance of discontinuation when criteria met

## Results Comparison

| Metric | Previous Implementation | Fixed Implementation |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Total Patients | 1000 | 1000 |
| Mean Visits per Patient | 5.6 | 8.6 |
| Mean Injections per Patient | 2.0 | 8.6 |
| Maintenance Phase Injection Rate | 0% | 100% |
| Loading Phase Completion Rate | 66.8% | 100% |
| Treatment Interval Mean | 4.0 weeks | 8.7 weeks |
| Mean Vision Change | +4.2 letters | +14.6 letters |
| Vision Improved Percent | 37.3% | 100% |

## Individual Patient Example (PATIENT001)

### Loading Phase (3 injections at 4-week intervals)
- 2023-01-03: First injection
- 2023-01-31: Second injection (~4 weeks later)
- 2023-02-28: Third injection (~4 weeks later)

### Maintenance Phase (all visits include injections)
- 2023-04-25: First maintenance visit (~8 weeks after loading)
- 2023-07-04: Second maintenance visit (~10 weeks later)
- 2023-09-26: Third maintenance visit (~12 weeks later)
- 2024-01-02: Fourth maintenance visit (~14 weeks later)
- 2024-04-23: Fifth maintenance visit (~16 weeks later)
- 2024-07-30: Sixth maintenance visit (~14 weeks later - decreased due to active disease)

### Vision Trajectory
- Starting vision: 65.0 letters
- Final vision: 85.0 letters
- Overall improvement: +20.0 letters

## Implementation Details

1. Created a new `treat_and_extend_des.py` file with a clean implementation
2. Updated `run_simulation.py` to use the new implementation
3. Updated `analyze_des_patients.py` to work with the new implementation
4. Removed redundant implementations to avoid confusion

## Remaining Differences Between ABS and DES

While the DES implementation now correctly follows the treat-and-extend protocol, there are still some differences between the ABS and DES implementations:

1. **Visit Frequency**:
   - ABS: 24.0 visits per patient
   - DES: 8.6 visits per patient

2. **Treatment Intervals**:
   - ABS: Fixed at ~3.9 weeks
   - DES: Dynamic 8→10→12→14→16 weeks

3. **Vision Outcomes**:
   - ABS: +6.4 letters
   - DES: +14.6 letters

These differences suggest that the ABS implementation may also need to be updated to correctly follow the treat-and-extend protocol.

## Conclusion

The fixed DES implementation now correctly models the treat-and-extend protocol as described in the Veeramani pathway diagram. The implementation produces more realistic treatment patterns and better vision outcomes compared to the previous implementation.
