Perfect! Let's run the eylea_literature_based simulation configuration, which is a more realistic scenario based on clinical literature. This configuration has interesting parameters:

Configuration Details
Simulation Parameters
Population: 1000 patients
Duration: 672 days (96 weeks/2 years)
Protocol: Treat-and-extend with Eylea (aflibercept 2mg)
Treatment Protocol
Loading phase: 3 injections at 4-week intervals
Maintenance phase: Dynamic intervals between 8-16 weeks
Interval adjustments: 2-week adjustments based on disease activity
Discontinuation Parameters
Stable at max interval: 20% probability after 3 consecutive stable visits
Random administrative: 5% annual probability (insurance issues, patient choice)
Treatment duration: 10% probability after 52 weeks of treatment
Monitoring: Follow-ups at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-discontinuation
Retreatment: 95% probability when disease recurs
Running the Simulation
To run this simulation, we'll need to toggle to Act mode and execute:

python run_simulation.py eylea_literature_based
What to Look For in Results
When we run this simulation, we should look for:

Discontinuation patterns:

How many patients discontinue treatment?
What's the most common reason for discontinuation?
When do most discontinuations occur during the 2-year period?
Vision outcomes:

How does mean visual acuity change over time?
Are there differences between patients who discontinue vs. those who don't?
Comparison between models:

Are there significant differences between ABS and DES results?
Which aspects show the most variation?
Treatment patterns:

Average number of injections per patient
Distribution of treatment intervals
The results will include visualizations and statistics that help us understand these aspects. The eylea_literature_based configuration should produce more realistic results than the default test simulation.

 python run_simulation.py eylea_literature_based      


 Simulation Analysis: eylea_literature_based
I've run the eylea_literature_based simulation and analyzed the results. Here are the key findings:

Simulation Results
Both Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) produced very similar results:

Visual Acuity Outcomes:

Starting baseline: ~71 ETDRS letters
Final mean vision: ~85 ETDRS letters
Mean improvement: ~14 letters
Both simulations showed rapid improvement in the first 10 weeks, followed by a plateau
Treatment Patterns:

ABS: 9.95 visits/injections per patient
DES: 8.49 visits/injections per patient
100% loading phase completion rate in both models
100% maintenance phase injection rate (every visit included an injection)
Treatment Intervals:

ABS: Mean interval of 9.29 weeks
DES: Mean interval of 8.60 weeks
Discontinuation Issue
I identified an issue with the discontinuation feature. Despite being enabled in the configuration file (discontinuation: enabled: true), the log shows:

INFO:simulation.discontinuation_manager:Initialized DiscontinuationManager with enabled=False
The issue is in both treat_and_extend_abs.py and treat_and_extend_des.py. The discontinuation manager is initialized with:

# Initialize discontinuation manager
discontinuation_params = self.config.get_treatment_discontinuation_params()
self.discontinuation_manager = DiscontinuationManager(self.config.parameters)
It's getting the discontinuation parameters but then initializing the manager with the entire config parameters instead of the specific discontinuation parameters. This is why we see no discontinuations in the results despite the feature being enabled in the configuration.

To fix this, the code should be modified to:

# Initialize discontinuation manager
discontinuation_params = self.config.get_treatment_discontinuation_params()
self.discontinuation_manager = DiscontinuationManager({"discontinuation": discontinuation_params})
Conclusion
The simulation successfully models the treat-and-extend protocol for Eylea (aflibercept) treatment, showing significant vision improvement that matches literature expectations. Both simulation approaches (ABS and DES) produce consistent results, validating the model's reliability.

The discontinuation feature is not working as expected due to the initialization issue, which prevents us from seeing how treatment discontinuation would affect long-term outcomes. Fixing this issue would allow for more realistic modeling of real-world treatment patterns where patients often discontinue treatment after achieving stable vision at maximum intervals.


Discontinuation Module Troubleshooting
I've analyzed the code and found the root cause of the discontinuation feature not working properly. Here's my assessment:

The Problem
The debug output shows that despite having discontinuation: enabled: true in the configuration, the discontinuation manager is being initialized with enabled=False:

INFO:simulation.discontinuation_manager:Initialized DiscontinuationManager with enabled=False
Root Cause
After examining the code in both treatment protocol implementations (ABS and DES), I found the issue in how the discontinuation manager is initialized:

In both treat_and_extend_abs.py and treat_and_extend_des.py, the code retrieves the discontinuation parameters but then passes the entire configuration parameters to the DiscontinuationManager:

# Initialize discontinuation manager
discontinuation_params = self.config.get_treatment_discontinuation_params()
self.discontinuation_manager = DiscontinuationManager(self.config.parameters)
The problem is that the DiscontinuationManager class expects a configuration structure with a top-level "discontinuation" key:

# From discontinuation_manager.py
def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
    self.config = config
    
    # Extract discontinuation configuration
    discontinuation_config = config.get("discontinuation", {})
    
    # Set default values if configuration is missing
    self.enabled = discontinuation_config.get("enabled", False)
    self.criteria = discontinuation_config.get("criteria", {})
    self.monitoring = discontinuation_config.get("monitoring", {})
    self.retreatment = discontinuation_config.get("retreatment", {})
When the entire self.config.parameters is passed, the manager tries to find a top-level "discontinuation" key which doesn't exist at that level, so it defaults to enabled=False.

Proposed Fix
The solution is to modify the initialization in both treat_and_extend_abs.py and treat_and_extend_des.py to properly structure the parameters for the DiscontinuationManager:

# Initialize discontinuation manager
discontinuation_params = self.config.get_treatment_discontinuation_params()
self.discontinuation_manager = DiscontinuationManager({"discontinuation": discontinuation_params})
This ensures that the manager receives the discontinuation parameters in the expected structure, with a top-level "discontinuation" key.

Next Steps
Modify the code in both treatment protocol implementations
Test the fix by running the same eylea_literature_based simulation
Verify that the discontinuation manager now shows as enabled in the logs
Analyze the simulation results to confirm discontinuations are occurring as expected
