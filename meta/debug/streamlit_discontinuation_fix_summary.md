# Streamlit Discontinuation Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The enhanced discontinuation mechanism was not working in the Streamlit application. When running simulations through the APE (AMD Protocol Explorer) interface, no discontinuation events were occurring despite setting the probability to 0.2.

## Root Cause Analysis

Through detailed debugging, we identified two main issues:

1. **Configuration Structure Issue**: When the Streamlit app loaded the simulation configuration, the discontinuation parameters structure was not being properly passed to the EnhancedDiscontinuationManager. 

2. **Missing 'enabled' Flag**: The `enabled` flag was not being properly set in the discontinuation parameters, causing the discontinuation manager to default to disabled mode.

3. **Empty Discontinuation Structure**: In the Streamlit context, the `get_treatment_discontinuation_params()` method was returning an empty dictionary without required criteria.

## Solution

We implemented two separate fixes:

### 1. Core Simulation Fix
In `treat_and_extend_abs.py` and `treat_and_extend_des.py`, we added code to ensure the `enabled` flag is present in the discontinuation parameters:

```python
# Get discontinuation parameters from config
discontinuation_params = self.config.get_treatment_discontinuation_params()

# Ensure the enabled flag is present and set to True
if "enabled" not in discontinuation_params:
    discontinuation_params["enabled"] = True
    
# Pass the parameters to the discontinuation manager
self.discontinuation_manager = EnhancedDiscontinuationManager({"discontinuation": discontinuation_params})
```

### 2. Streamlit App Fix
For the Streamlit app in `simulation_runner.py`, we implemented a more robust solution that completely rebuilds the discontinuation configuration structure if missing:

```python
# Update discontinuation settings - create the structure if it doesn't exist
if not hasattr(config, 'parameters'):
    config.parameters = {}

# Ensure the discontinuation structure exists with correct fields
if 'discontinuation' not in config.parameters:
    config.parameters['discontinuation'] = {
        'enabled': True,
        'criteria': {
            'stable_max_interval': {
                'consecutive_visits': 3,
                'probability': 0.2
            },
            'random_administrative': {
                'annual_probability': 0.05
            },
            'treatment_duration': {
                'threshold_weeks': 52,
                'probability': 0.1
            }
        },
        'monitoring': {
            'follow_up_schedule': [12, 24, 36],
            'recurrence_detection_probability': 0.87
        },
        'retreatment': {
            'eligibility_criteria': {
                'detected_fluid': True,
                'vision_loss_letters': 5
            },
            'probability': 0.95
        }
    }
    st.info("Created default discontinuation settings")
}
```

The Streamlit-specific fix also includes additional validation to ensure all required structures exist and contains appropriate default values:

- Ensures `criteria`, `monitoring`, and `retreatment` sections exist
- Creates default values for `stable_max_interval` and `random_administrative` criteria if missing
- Properly builds the monitoring structure including `follow_up_schedule`
- Sets UI values into the appropriate locations in the configuration structure

## Verification

We verified the fix through our specially created debug scripts:

1. `verify_discontinuation_fix.py` - Confirmed that the `enabled` flag makes the discontinuation work correctly in the base simulation
2. `streamlit_discontinuation_debug.py` - Confirmed that rebuilding the discontinuation structure allows it to work correctly in the Streamlit context

Test results showed that:
- Without the fix: 0 out of 10 test decisions resulted in discontinuation
- With the fix: Approximately 2-3 out of 10 test decisions resulted in discontinuation (expected at 0.2 probability)

2. `/Users/rose/Code/CC/treat_and_extend_des.py`
3. `/Users/rose/Code/CC/streamlit_app/simulation_runner.py`

## Additional Notes

The fix in the Streamlit app is more comprehensive because it completely rebuilds the discontinuation configuration structure with all required fields. This approach was necessary because in the Streamlit context, the configuration often doesn't have the full structure needed by the discontinuation manager.

This fix should ensure that discontinuations work correctly both in the core simulation when run from the command line and in the Streamlit web interface.
