# DES Integration Test Fix Prompt

Now that we've successfully fixed the ABS integration tests for the enhanced discontinuation model, I need your help to fix the DES integration tests as well. When running the DES tests, I'm encountering the following error:

```
AttributeError: <class 'treat_and_extend_des.TreatAndExtendDES'> does not have the attribute 'generate_patients'
```

This suggests that the DES implementation is different from the ABS implementation. The error occurs in the `_run_simulation` method of the `EnhancedDiscontinuationDESTest` class, which is trying to patch the `generate_patients` method of the `TreatAndExtendDES` class.

Please examine the DES implementation in `treat_and_extend_des.py` and the DES test file `tests/integration/test_enhanced_discontinuation_des.py` to understand how the DES simulation works and how it differs from the ABS implementation. Then, update the DES tests to work with the DES implementation.

Some specific tasks:

1. Analyze the `TreatAndExtendDES` class in `treat_and_extend_des.py` to understand how it initializes and runs simulations.
2. Compare it with the `TreatAndExtendABS` class to identify key differences.
3. Update the `_run_simulation` method in `EnhancedDiscontinuationDESTest` to work with the DES implementation.
4. Apply a similar approach to what we did for the ABS tests, particularly for the `test_stable_discontinuation_monitoring_recurrence_retreatment_pathway` test.
5. Make any other necessary changes to ensure all DES tests pass.

The goal is to have all DES integration tests passing, just like we achieved with the ABS tests. Please provide a detailed explanation of the changes you make and why they're necessary.
