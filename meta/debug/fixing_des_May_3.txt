After analyzing the output log and comparing the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) results, I can see several significant discrepancies that explain why the simulation isn't matching your expectations:

Key Discrepancies
Patient Volume & Treatment Completion

ABS: 1000 patients, 24.01 visits/patient, 24.01 injections/patient
DES: 288 patients, 4.08 visits/patient, 1.27 injections/patient
Critical issue: DES has 0% loading phase completion rate vs 100% in ABS
Treatment Intervals

ABS average interval: 3.91 weeks (far below the expected 8+ weeks)
DES interval: 4.0 weeks (suggests only initial loading phase visits)
Patient Scheduling

DES is scheduling approximately 3 patients/week (as indicated in logs)
This explains the 288 patients over 96 weeks (3 × 96 ≈ 288)
ABS appears to create all 1000 patients at simulation start
Root Causes
Based on my analysis, here are the likely causes:

DES Implementation Issues

Patient scheduling is working as designed (3/week) but most patients aren't completing their treatment protocol
The low injection count (1.27/patient) suggests most patients only receive 1 injection and never return
Something is preventing follow-up visits from being properly scheduled
ABS Implementation Issues

Treatment intervals don't match the protocol (3.91 weeks vs expected minimum 8 weeks)
The simulation appears to complete instantly ("End time: 2023-01-01 00:00:00")
This suggests the ABS might not be correctly advancing time or scheduling follow-ups
Protocol Translation

The treat-and-extend protocol defined in the configuration may not be correctly translating to scheduled events
Particularly in the DES implementation, events after initial visits aren't occurring
Next Steps
To resolve these issues, I would need to:

Check the DiscreteEventSimulation class to see how it schedules follow-up visits
Examine how disease state transitions trigger treatment decisions
Verify the implementation of the dynamic interval protocol step
Check if there's a mismatch between the protocol definition and its implementation
Would you like me to look at any specific part of the implementation code? For example:

The DiscreteEventSimulation class
The protocol parser implementation
The scheduler implementation
I believe the issue is primarily in how follow-up visits are (not) being scheduled in the DES implementation.

After examining the DiscreteEventSimulation class and PatientState class, I've identified several issues that explain the simulation discrepancies:

Major Issues in the DES Implementation
Protocol Registration Problem

# In DiscreteEventSimulation.__init__
protocol_type = "test_simulation"  # Use the type from YAML config
This hardcoded value likely causes a mismatch with the intended protocol configuration. The eylea_literature_based.yaml specifies the protocol type, but the code ignores it and always uses "test_simulation".

Phase Transition Failure
The loading phase (3 initial injections) is never completing:

# Loading phase completion rate: 0.0%
This explains why patients are only getting 1.27 injections on average - they're getting stuck early in the treatment pathway.

Treatment Protocol Implementation Issues
The DES implementation doesn't properly translate the YAML-defined treat-and-extend protocol:

No mechanism to track whether fluid was detected
No implementation of the interval adjustment (8→10→12→14→16 weeks)
No implementation of the "treat on fluid detection" logic
Visit Scheduling Limitation

# Only schedule next visit if we haven't reached the end date
if event.time + timedelta(weeks=next_interval) <= self.clock.end_date:
    # Schedule the next visit
This prevents scheduling visits that would occur after the simulation end date, which might be prematurely terminating treatment for many patients.

Patient Volume Discrepancy
The DES generates only 288 patients despite the configuration specifying 1000. This is due to the patient generator's rate (3 patients/week for 96 weeks = ~288 patients).

Root Cause Analysis
The core problem appears to be in how the treat-and-extend protocol defined in the YAML configuration is being translated into actual simulation logic:

The DES code doesn't seem to be reading the protocol configuration correctly
Phase transitions aren't working - patients aren't completing the loading phase
The logic for interval adjustment based on disease activity isn't implemented
In the PatientState class, I noticed:

Initial next_visit_interval is set to 4 weeks, which is correct for the loading phase
There's a discontinue_treatment method that may be triggering too early
The treatment protocol implementation doesn't match the Veeramani pathway diagram
Proposed Solutions
Fix the protocol registration to use the config's protocol type rather than hardcoding "test_simulation"
Debug the phase transition logic to ensure patients complete the loading phase
Implement proper treat-and-extend logic for interval adjustments based on disease state
Ensure the patient generator creates the configured number of patients
Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of these issues for further investigation? I could examine:

The ABS implementation to understand why it's also not matching expectations
The protocol parser to see how YAML configs are translated into actions
How disease activity is mapped to interval adjustments

Great! The simulation is working correctly. Let's summarize what we've accomplished:


Task Completed


DES Implementation Fixed Successfully
I've successfully fixed the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) implementation to properly follow the treat-and-extend protocol according to the Veeramani pathway diagram. The key issue was that patients were not receiving injections at every visit during the maintenance phase, which is a fundamental requirement of the treat-and-extend protocol.

Solution Implemented
Created a new treat_and_extend_des.py implementation that:

Ensures patients receive injections at every visit (both loading and maintenance phases)
Correctly implements the loading phase (3 injections at 4-week intervals)
Properly transitions to the maintenance phase with 8-week intervals
Follows the 8→10→12→14→16 week interval progression for stable patients
Decreases intervals by 2 weeks when fluid is detected
Updated run_simulation.py to use this new implementation

Created an analysis script (analyze_des_patients.py) to examine individual patient data

Removed redundant implementations to avoid confusion

Added comprehensive documentation in meta/des_implementation_fix.md

Results Comparison (Before vs. After Fix)
| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Total Patients | 1000 | 1000 |
| Mean Visits per Patient | 5.6 | 8.6 |
| Mean Injections per Patient | 2.0 | 8.6 |
| Maintenance Phase Injection Rate | 0% | 100% |
| Loading Phase Completion Rate | 66.8% | 100% |
| Treatment Interval Mean | 4.0 weeks | 8.6 weeks |
| Mean Vision Change | +4.2 letters | +14.6 letters |
| Vision Improved Percent | 37.3% | 100% |

Key Improvements
Correct Protocol Implementation: Patients now receive injections at every visit, as required by the treat-and-extend protocol.

Better Treatment Patterns: The treatment intervals now follow the expected pattern (8→10→12→14→16 weeks) instead of being fixed at 4 weeks.

Improved Vision Outcomes: The mean vision improvement increased from +4.2 to +14.6 letters, reflecting the benefit of proper treatment.

Complete Loading Phase: All patients now complete the loading phase (3 injections), compared to only 66.8% before.

Verification
The patient visit data confirms that the implementation is working correctly. For example, patient PATIENT333:

2023-04-11: Loading phase - Injection
2023-05-09: Loading phase - Injection (~4 weeks later)
2023-06-06: Loading phase - Injection (~4 weeks later)
2023-08-01: Maintenance phase - Injection (~8 weeks later)
2023-10-10: Maintenance phase - Injection (~10 weeks later)
2024-01-02: Maintenance phase - Injection (~12 weeks later)
2024-03-12: Maintenance phase - Injection (~10 weeks later - decreased due to fluid)
2024-06-04: Maintenance phase - Injection (~12 weeks later)
2024-09-10: Maintenance phase - Injection (~14 weeks later)
Next Steps
While the DES implementation now correctly follows the treat-and-extend protocol, there are still some differences between the ABS and DES implementations:

The ABS implementation shows more visits per patient (24.0 vs. 8.6 in DES)
The treatment intervals in ABS are fixed at ~3.9 weeks instead of following the 8-16 week protocol
The vision improvement in DES is higher (+14.6 letters) than in ABS (+6.5 letters)
These differences suggest that the ABS implementation may also need to be updated to correctly follow the treat-and-extend protocol.

All changes have been committed to the git repository, and comprehensive documentation has been added in meta/des_implementation_fix.md.



Based on the files I've read so far, I understand that: 1. From `meta/debug/fixing_des_May_3.txt`: - There was a significant discrepancy between Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) - The issues in the DES have been fixed, and the treat_and_extend_des.py implementation now correctly follows the protocol. - The ABS still shows issues that need to be fixed (fixed treatment intervals, more visits per patient, etc.) 2. From `meta/sample_output.log`: - This shows the output from running both ABS and DES simulations with the fixed DES implementation. - Key differences between ABS and DES remain: - ABS: 24.006 visits/patient, 24.006 injections/patient, 3.91 week intervals - DES: 8.615 visits/patient, 8.615 injections/patient, 8.63 week intervals - The DES is now correctly implementing the treatment protocol with the right treatment intervals. 3. From `meta/Veeramani_pathway_amd_diagram.md`: - This is a mermaid diagram showing the correct treatment pathway for AMD - Loading phase: 3 injections at 4-week intervals - Maintenance phase: Start at 8 weeks, can increase to 10→12→14→16 weeks if no fluid, decrease by 2 weeks (to min 8) if fluid detected 4. From `simulation/abs.py`: - The ABS implementation follows a different scheduling approach than the DES - Key issue: It uses a fixed schedule for the first year and doesn't properly implement the dynamic interval adjustment - The `schedule_next_visit` method has a fixed schedule: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52] (basically every 4 weeks) 5. From `treat_and_extend_des.py`: - This is the fixed DES implementation that correctly follows the treat-and-extend protocol - It properly implements the loading phase (3 injections at 4 weeks) and maintenance phase (8→10→12→14→16 weeks) - It adjusts intervals based on disease activity (fluid detection) The task is to fix the ABS implementation in a similar way to how the DES implementation was fixed, by making it correctly follow the treat-and-extend protocol as shown in the Veeramani pathway diagram. Key issues to fix in ABS: 1. The fixed scheduling approach that doesn't follow the protocol 2. The lack of proper implementation for the loading and maintenance phases 3. The incorrect treatment intervals (3.91 weeks instead of the protocol-defined intervals) A plan to fix the ABS would be: 1. Create a new implementation or modify the existing ABS to properly follow the treat-and-extend protocol 2. Ensure it handles the loading phase with 3 injections at 4-week intervals 3. Implement the maintenance phase with dynamic interval adjustments (8→10→12→14→16 weeks) 4. Adjust intervals based on disease activity (fluid detection) 5. Update the patient state tracking to properly record phase transitions 6. Update the scheduler to use the appropriate intervals 7. Ensure all patients receive injections at every visit 8. Test the implementation and compare results with the DES implementation‎

Let me analyze what I've found and create a plan for fixing the ABS simulation similar to how the DES simulation was fixed.


ABS Simulation Fix Analysis & Plan
Based on my review of the files you've shared, I can see that while the DES (Discrete Event Simulation) implementation has been successfully fixed to follow the treat-and-extend protocol, the ABS (Agent-Based Simulation) implementation still has issues that need to be addressed.

Key Issues with the ABS Implementation
Incorrect Treatment Intervals:

ABS shows average intervals of 3.91 weeks, far below the expected 8+ weeks in the maintenance phase
The simulation uses a fixed schedule instead of dynamic interval adjustments
Protocol Misalignment:

The ABS implementation doesn't properly follow the Veeramani pathway
It doesn't correctly transition between loading and maintenance phases
It doesn't implement the 8→10→12→14→16 week interval progression
Scheduling Mechanism:

The schedule_next_visit method uses a fixed schedule for the first year:
fixed_schedule = [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52]
This results in approximately 4-week intervals regardless of disease activity
Patient State Tracking:

The ABS implementation doesn't properly track or handle phase transitions
It doesn't adjust treatment intervals based on fluid detection
Comparison of ABS vs Fixed DES
| Metric | ABS (Current) | DES (Fixed) |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Mean Visits per Patient | 24.01 | 8.6 |
| Mean Injections per Patient | 24.01 | 8.6 |
| Treatment Interval Mean | 3.91 weeks | 8.63 weeks |
| Vision Improvement | +6.5 letters | +14.6 letters |

Proposed Solution
Similar to how the DES implementation was fixed, I recommend creating or modifying the ABS implementation to correctly follow the treat-and-extend protocol. Here's my proposed plan:

Implement Proper Phase Management:

Create distinct loading and maintenance phases
Ensure the loading phase consists of 3 injections at 4-week intervals
Properly transition to the maintenance phase after the loading phase is complete
Dynamic Interval Adjustment:

Start maintenance phase at 8-week intervals as per the protocol
Implement the 8→10→12→14→16 week interval progression for stable patients
Decrease intervals by 2 weeks (but not below 8) when fluid is detected
Disease Activity Tracking:

Track fluid detection at each visit
Adjust intervals based on disease activity
Track consecutive stable visits for potential discontinuation
Schedule Next Visit:

Replace the fixed schedule with dynamic interval calculation
Ensure next visits are scheduled according to the current phase and disease activity
Patient State Updates:

Update the patient state to track:
Current phase (loading or maintenance)
Treatments received in current phase
Current interval
Consecutive stable visits
Fluid detection status
Technical Approach
Code Structure Options:

Option A: Create a new file treat_and_extend_abs.py similar to treat_and_extend_des.py
Option B: Modify the existing simulation/abs.py file to correctly implement the protocol
Implementation Focus:

The key method to modify is schedule_next_visit in the ABS implementation
We need to add phase tracking to the Patient class
Update the process_event method to handle phases and treatments correctly
Testing & Validation:

Run the modified ABS implementation and compare results with the fixed DES
Check for proper treatment intervals (should match the protocol)
Verify that all patients receive injections at every visit
Confirm the loading and maintenance phases are correctly implemented
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this fix for the ABS simulation? And do you have a preference for creating a new implementation file or modifying the existing one?
