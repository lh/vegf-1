# Known Issues

1. Need validation schema for YAML protocol files
2. Error handling for invalid protocol configurations needed
3. Need to implement proper logging system
4. Documentation needed for simulation configuration
5. Need to handle edge cases in treatment protocols (e.g., missed visits)
6. Visualization tools need performance optimization for large datasets
