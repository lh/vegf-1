# Known Issues

1. Need validation schema for YAML protocol files ✓
2. Error handling for invalid protocol configurations needed ✓
3. Need to implement proper logging system
4. Documentation needed for simulation configuration
5. Need to handle edge cases in treatment protocols (e.g., missed visits)
6. Visualization tools need performance optimization for large datasets
7. Need comprehensive test coverage for all simulation components
8. Performance bottlenecks in large-scale simulations
9. Need better error reporting for protocol validation failures
10. Resource utilization tracking needs optimization
11. Need automated protocol comparison tools
12. Missing sensitivity analysis framework
13. Need better documentation of protocol configuration options
14. Missing real-world validation framework
