# Eylea Data Analysis Progress

## Current Status (March 18, 2025)

We have made significant progress in analyzing the Eylea treatment data:

1. **PCA Analysis of Treatment Intervals and Visual Acuity**
   - Implemented PCA analysis to identify patterns in treatment intervals and visual acuity measures
   - Identified distinct clusters of treatment patterns using K-means clustering with k=2, 3, and 4
   - Discovered a small but significant group of patients with very long treatment gaps
   - Detailed findings are available in [reports/eylea_analysis/pca_treatment_patterns.md](../reports/eylea_analysis/pca_treatment_patterns.md)

2. **Treatment Pattern Analysis**
   - Identified two hypothesized treatment groups: LH (continuous treatment) and MR (treatment with pause)
   - Developed criteria for manual classification of these groups
   - Applied K-means clustering to validate and refine the group definitions
   - Detailed findings are available in [reports/eylea_analysis/treatment_patterns_analysis.md](../reports/eylea_analysis/treatment_patterns_analysis.md)

3. **Data Processing and Visualization**
   - Generated comprehensive visualizations of treatment patterns and outcomes
   - Created summary statistics for different patient groups
   - Saved analysis results to the output/analysis_results directory

## Previous Status (February 25, 2025)

We have successfully fixed several issues in the Eylea data analysis code that were causing test failures and analysis problems. The main improvements include:

1. **Reduced Debug Output**
   - Changed logging level from DEBUG to ERROR in eylea_data_analysis.py
   - Added specific logging configuration to suppress matplotlib and PIL debug messages
   - This prevents overwhelming the context window with unnecessary log information

2. **Enhanced VA Trajectory Analysis**
   - Improved attribute access handling in analyze_va_trajectories method
   - Added robust error handling for accessing VA scores and injection dates
   - Ensured proper type conversion for VA scores
   - These changes make the code more resilient when handling different data formats and column names

3. **Fixed Test Data Issues**
   - Updated test_patient_cohort_analysis_with_age_data to properly set deceased status
   - Ensured deceased status is properly converted to integer in patient_data
   - Added additional assertions to verify test expectations

4. **Fixed Treatment Course Analysis**
   - Modified the `analyze_treatment_courses` method to treat all injections for an eye as a single course
   - Added tracking of long pauses (>365 days) with the `has_long_pause` flag
   - Preserved potential separate courses information in `potential_courses_detail` field
   - This approach allows for future analysis of treatment patterns while maintaining a single course per eye

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for the 'Deceased' column conversion
   - Fixed issues with non-numeric values in various columns
   - Enhanced data validation to handle edge cases

All tests are now passing, and the code successfully analyzes both sample data and the full dataset. The analysis on the full dataset (23,962 injections from 1,775 patients) shows a mean injection interval of 77.3 days.

## Next Steps

1. **Parameter Estimation**
   - Use the analysis results to estimate parameters for simulation models
   - Validate the estimated parameters against expected ranges
   - Document any adjustments needed for the parameter estimation process

2. **Integration with Simulation**
   - Ensure the estimated parameters can be properly used in the simulation models
   - Test the simulation with the new parameters
   - Compare simulation results with real-world data to validate accuracy

3. **Further Analysis Refinement**
   - Consider implementing separate treatment course analysis for advanced studies
   - Explore patterns in treatment gaps and their impact on outcomes
   - Analyze the relationship between treatment frequency and visual outcomes

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the analysis code
   - Document any assumptions or limitations in the analysis
   - Provide guidance for future data analysis tasks

## Technical Notes

- The main issue with the treatment course analysis was that the original sample data had a unique UUID for each injection, making it impossible to track multiple injections for the same patient/eye.
- The deceased status validation now properly handles all test cases and non-numeric values, ensuring that age data is correctly processed for both living and deceased patients.
- The logging configuration has been optimized to provide useful information without overwhelming output.
- The treatment course analysis now preserves information about potential separate courses while maintaining a single course per eye for the current analysis.
