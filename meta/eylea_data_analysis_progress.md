# Eylea Data Analysis Progress

## Current Status (March 18, 2025)

### PCA Analysis of Treatment Intervals and Visual Acuity

We have implemented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns in treatment intervals and visual acuity measures. The analysis focused on:
- Treatment interval (days between injections)
- Previous VA (visual acuity at previous injection)
- Current VA (visual acuity at current injection)
- Next VA (visual acuity at next injection)

The PCA analysis revealed several distinct clusters of treatment patterns:

#### Two-Cluster Analysis:
1. **Cluster 1** (5,165 records):
   - Higher average interval: 83.6 days
   - Lower average VA: ~41-42 letters
   - Greater VA decline: -0.65 letters between injections

2. **Cluster 2** (11,604 records):
   - Lower average interval: 73.5 days
   - Higher average VA: ~68-69 letters
   - Less VA decline: -0.21 letters between injections

#### Three-Cluster Analysis:
1. **Cluster 1** (5,331 records):
   - Moderate interval: 80.5 days
   - Moderate VA: ~56 letters
   - Moderate VA decline: -0.45 letters

2. **Cluster 2** (3,028 records):
   - Longer interval: 86.2 days
   - Low VA: ~35 letters
   - Greater VA decline: -0.61 letters

3. **Cluster 3** (8,410 records):
   - Shorter interval: 70.7 days
   - High VA: ~72 letters
   - Less VA decline: -0.19 letters

#### Four-Cluster Analysis:
The four-cluster analysis revealed a particularly interesting small group:

4. **Cluster 4** (207 records):
   - Very long intervals: 793.7 days (>2 years)
   - Moderate starting VA: 64.4 letters
   - Significant VA drop at injection: 52.4 letters
   - VA improvement after injection: +1.59 letters

This suggests a group of patients who have very long gaps between treatments, experience significant vision loss during the gap, but show improvement after receiving an injection.

### Previous Treatment Pattern Analysis

We have successfully implemented a new analysis to identify distinct treatment patterns in Eylea patients, specifically focusing on two hypothesized groups:

1. **Group LH**: Patients who receive 7 injections in first year and then continue with injections approximately every two months.
2. **Group MR**: Patients who receive 7 injections in first year, then have a pause before resumption of treatment.

The analysis identified:
- 36 patients in Group LH (2.1% of total)
- 33 patients in Group MR (1.9% of total)
- 382 patients with exactly 7 injections in first year (22.2% of total)

We also performed K-means clustering which identified similar patterns but with more patients in each group, suggesting our manual criteria may be too strict.

A detailed report of this analysis is available in [eylea_treatment_patterns_analysis.md](eylea_treatment_patterns_analysis.md).

## Previous Status (February 25, 2025)

We have successfully fixed several issues in the Eylea data analysis code that were causing test failures and analysis problems. The main improvements include:

1. **Reduced Debug Output**
   - Changed logging level from DEBUG to ERROR in eylea_data_analysis.py
   - Added specific logging configuration to suppress matplotlib and PIL debug messages
   - This prevents overwhelming the context window with unnecessary log information

2. **Enhanced VA Trajectory Analysis**
   - Improved attribute access handling in analyze_va_trajectories method
   - Added robust error handling for accessing VA scores and injection dates
   - Ensured proper type conversion for VA scores
   - These changes make the code more resilient when handling different data formats and column names

3. **Fixed Test Data Issues**
   - Updated test_patient_cohort_analysis_with_age_data to properly set deceased status
   - Ensured deceased status is properly converted to integer in patient_data
   - Added additional assertions to verify test expectations

4. **Fixed Treatment Course Analysis**
   - Modified the `analyze_treatment_courses` method to treat all injections for an eye as a single course
   - Added tracking of long pauses (>365 days) with the `has_long_pause` flag
   - Preserved potential separate courses information in `potential_courses_detail` field
   - This approach allows for future analysis of treatment patterns while maintaining a single course per eye

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for the 'Deceased' column conversion
   - Fixed issues with non-numeric values in various columns
   - Enhanced data validation to handle edge cases

All tests are now passing, and the code successfully analyzes both sample data and the full dataset. The analysis on the full dataset (23,962 injections from 1,775 patients) shows a mean injection interval of 77.3 days.

## Next Steps

1. **Parameter Estimation**
   - Use the analysis results to estimate parameters for simulation models
   - Validate the estimated parameters against expected ranges
   - Document any adjustments needed for the parameter estimation process

2. **Integration with Simulation**
   - Ensure the estimated parameters can be properly used in the simulation models
   - Test the simulation with the new parameters
   - Compare simulation results with real-world data to validate accuracy

3. **Further Analysis Refinement**
   - Consider implementing separate treatment course analysis for advanced studies
   - Explore patterns in treatment gaps and their impact on outcomes
   - Analyze the relationship between treatment frequency and visual outcomes

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes made to the analysis code
   - Document any assumptions or limitations in the analysis
   - Provide guidance for future data analysis tasks

## Technical Notes

- The main issue with the treatment course analysis was that the original sample data had a unique UUID for each injection, making it impossible to track multiple injections for the same patient/eye.
- The deceased status validation now properly handles all test cases and non-numeric values, ensuring that age data is correctly processed for both living and deceased patients.
- The logging configuration has been optimized to provide useful information without overwhelming output.
- The treatment course analysis now preserves information about potential separate courses while maintaining a single course per eye for the current analysis.
