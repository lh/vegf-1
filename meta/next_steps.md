## Current Phase
3. Clinical Model Integration (Continued)
   - [ ] Advanced OCT Modeling (Completion)
     * Implement anatomical constraints
     * Add biomarker tracking
   - [ ] Risk Factor Integration (Completion)
     * Implement time-dependent evolution
     * Create risk factor validation tests
   - [ ] Configuration System Updates
     * Add new clinical parameters
     * Maintain backward compatibility
     * Create migration utilities
     * Update validation schemas
   - [ ] Testing & Validation (Completion)
     * Add integration test suite

## Next Steps
1. Complete the remaining tasks in the Clinical Model Integration phase:
   - Finish Advanced OCT Modeling by implementing anatomical constraints and adding biomarker tracking
   - Complete Risk Factor Integration by implementing time-dependent evolution and creating validation tests
   - Update the Configuration System to include new clinical parameters, ensure backward compatibility, create migration utilities, and update validation schemas
   - Finalize Testing & Validation by adding an integration test suite and performance benchmarks

2. Implement visualization capabilities for comparing simulation runs:
   - Create a new visualization module for comparing mean acuity between DES and ABS models
   - Ensure the new visualization is similar to the existing 'des_mean_acuity.png'
   - Add functionality to overlay results from both models on the same graph
   - Implement options for customizing the visualization (e.g., time range, patient subgroups)

3. Review and update the Configuration Requirements to ensure they align with the latest changes in the clinical model

4. Begin planning for the next phases:
   - Further Visualization Improvements
   - Analysis Methods Enhancement

5. Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire ABS implementation to ensure consistency and alignment with project goals

6. Update documentation to reflect recent changes and additions to the clinical model, including the new visualization capabilities

## Future Phases
4. Configuration System Updates
5. Visualization Improvements
6. Analysis Methods Enhancement
