## Next Steps
1. Complete the remaining tasks in the Clinical Model Integration phase:
   - Finish Advanced OCT Modeling by implementing anatomical constraints and adding biomarker tracking
   - Complete Risk Factor Integration by implementing time-dependent evolution and creating validation tests
   - Update the Configuration System to include new clinical parameters, ensure backward compatibility, create migration utilities, and update validation schemas
   - Finalize Testing & Validation by adding an integration test suite and performance benchmarks

2. Review and update the Configuration Requirements to ensure they align with the latest changes in the clinical model

3. Begin planning for the next phases:
   - Visualization Improvements
   - Analysis Methods Enhancement

4. Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire ABS implementation to ensure consistency and alignment with project goals

5. Update documentation to reflect recent changes and additions to the clinical model
