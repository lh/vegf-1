# DES Simulation Refactoring Status

## Completed Changes

The refactoring of the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to handle clinic capacity on a daily basis has been completed. The following changes have been implemented:

1. Updated SimulationConfig:
   - Changed DES parameters to focus on daily capacity
   - Added days_per_week parameter
   - Removed minute-based scheduling parameters

2. Updated DES implementation (simulation/des.py):
   - Removed minute-based resource tracking
   - Added daily slot tracking
   - Updated visit handling to work with daily capacity
   - Implemented clinic day awareness (Mon-Fri by default)
   - Changed rescheduling logic to work with days instead of minutes
   - Removed schedule_resource_release method
   - Removed resource utilization tracking
   - Updated visit data structure to use actions_performed

3. Updated test infrastructure:
   - Modified test configuration to use daily_capacity and days_per_week
   - Updated test output to show scheduling statistics
   - Removed obsolete resource utilization reporting

## Testing Results

The DES simulation refactoring has been successfully verified:

1. Daily Capacity Management:
   - Correctly using configured daily_capacity (20 patients/day)
   - Properly respecting days_per_week (5 days, Mon-Fri)
   - All 7 test patients receiving scheduled visits
   - Minimal rescheduling needed (14 rescheduled visits total)

2. Visit Scheduling:
   - All visits occur on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
   - Proper week-based intervals (4 weeks loading, 12 weeks maintenance)
   - No queue_full_events observed
   - Visits distributed efficiently across available clinic days

3. Patient Outcomes:
   - All patients completed expected visits (12 visits each)
   - Vision improvements tracked and recorded
   - Phase transitions (loading to maintenance) working correctly
   - Visit histories properly maintained

## Next Steps

1. Consider Additional Optimizations:
   - Review rescheduling algorithm for further improvements
   - Analyze visit distribution patterns
   - Consider adding capacity utilization metrics

2. Documentation:
   - Update design documentation with new scheduling approach
   - Document configuration parameters and their effects

## Key Concepts

The refactoring has moved from a minute-by-minute resource management model to a more realistic daily capacity model that:
- Tracks available slots per day
- Respects clinic working days (e.g. Mon-Fri)
- Schedules follow-up visits in weeks
- Better reflects how real clinics operate

This should eliminate the unrealistic queue_full_events and provide a more accurate simulation of clinic operations.
