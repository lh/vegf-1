# Implementation Plan for ABS Improvements

# ABS Implementation Progress

## Completed
1. Patient Generation Enhancement (Phase 1)
   - ✓ Implemented ABSPatientGenerator class
   - ✓ Added risk factor generation
   - ✓ Implemented disease activity calculation
   - ✓ Added baseline vision generation
   - ✓ Created comprehensive test suite

## Next Phase (Start New Conversation)
2. Agent State Management
   - [ ] Create AgentState class
   - [ ] Implement timeline alignment
   - [ ] Add outcome tracking
   - [ ] Create state management tests
   - [ ] Integrate with clinical model

3. Future Phases
   - [ ] Clinical Model Integration
   - [ ] Configuration System Updates
   - [ ] Visualization Improvements
   - [ ] Analysis Methods Enhancement

## Implementation Details

### AgentState Class (Next Phase)
The AgentState class will need to:
- Handle patient state transitions
- Track treatment history
- Manage visit timelines
- Calculate and store outcomes
- Interface with clinical model

### Configuration Requirements
```yaml
abs_parameters:
  patient_generation:
    rate_per_week: 3
    random_seed: 42
  clinic_capacity:
    daily_slots: 20
    days_per_week: 5
  outcome_measures:
    vision_improvement_threshold: 5
    treatment_success_threshold: 70
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for full workflow
- Validation against DES results
- Performance benchmarking

## Expected Benefits
1. More Realistic Patient Flow
2. Better State Management
3. Improved Analysis Capabilities
4. Enhanced Configurability

## Notes
- Start new conversation for AgentState implementation
- Maintain test coverage throughout
- Document design decisions
