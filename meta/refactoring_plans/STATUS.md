# Refactoring Plans Status

## Current Status: ON HOLD
These refactoring plans are not currently being implemented. They are preserved here for future reference.

## Active Work
The current active work is on the `feature/financial-analysis` branch, focusing on Aflibercept 2mg protocol development and financial modeling.

## Refactoring Documents

### 1. REFACTORING_PLAN_CONSOLIDATED.md ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- **Created**: 2025-01-13
- **Approach**: Dual-mode structure (deployment vs development)
- **Key Innovation**: Single repository with clear separation
- **Status**: Most comprehensive and practical approach

### 2. REFACTORING_PLAN.md
- **Approach**: Simple extraction of APE to root
- **Focus**: Minimal changes, archive old code
- **Status**: Superseded by consolidated plan

### 3. REFACTORING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **Approach**: Three-system separation with multiple repositories
- **Focus**: Complete separation of concerns
- **Status**: Too complex, evolved into simpler approaches

## When to Use These Plans
These plans should be revisited when:
1. Deployment becomes a bottleneck
2. Development tools interfere with production
3. Repository size affects performance
4. Clear separation is needed for security/compliance

## Key Takeaway
The consolidated plan offers the best balance of:
- Easy deployment without losing development tools
- Single repository simplicity
- Clear boundaries between production and development
- Minimal disruption to existing workflows
