# Streamgraph Phase Tracking Implementation

## Problem Statement

The current streamgraph visualization in the Streamlit application isn't showing discontinuation and retreatment states correctly. The issue is that the visualization code is looking for explicit flags like `is_discontinuation_visit` or `discontinued` in the visit data, but these flags aren't always present.

Instead, the simulation tracks patient state transitions implicitly through changes in the `phase` field:
- A transition from `loading/maintenance` phase to `monitoring` phase indicates a discontinuation
- A transition from `monitoring` phase back to `loading/maintenance` phase indicates a retreatment

## Solution Approach

We've implemented a new approach that analyzes phase transitions to detect discontinuations and retreatments. This solution:

1. Tracks all phase transitions in chronological order for each patient
2. Identifies key transition patterns (e.g., treatment → monitoring = discontinuation)
3. Maintains patient state through the entire timeline (active, discontinued, retreated)
4. Correctly visualizes these states in the streamgraph over time

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **Phase Transition Analysis**:
   ```python
   def analyze_phase_transitions(patient_visits: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Analyze patient phase transitions to detect discontinuations and retreatments"""
       # Track chronological phase changes
       # Detect treatment → monitoring transitions (discontinuation)
       # Detect monitoring → treatment transitions (retreatment)
       # Determine discontinuation type based on context
   ```

2. **Patient State Determination**:
   ```python
   def determine_patient_state(patient_analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
       """Determine a patient's current state based on phase transition analysis"""
       # Map phase transition patterns to patient states
       # Track if patient has discontinued and/or been retreated
       # Consider most recent phase for current state
   ```

3. **Temporal State Tracking**:
   ```python
   def count_patient_states_by_phase(results: Dict) -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Count patient states across each time point"""
       # Analyze states month by month
       # For each patient at each month, get visits up to that point
       # Analyze phase transitions to determine current state
       # Aggregate counts of patients in each state
   ```

## Verification

We've verified this implementation with simulations of various sizes:
- Small test (20 patients): Successfully detected discontinuations and retreatments
- Large test (100 patients): Successfully tracked states over time
  
By month 60 in the 100-patient simulation:
- 25% remained active (never discontinued)
- 47% were active after retreatment
- 15% were discontinued after retreatment
- 13% were discontinued (planned)

This matches the expected behavior based on the simulation parameters.

## Integration Plan

To integrate this into the Streamlit app:

1. Add the new `streamgraph_fixed_phase_tracking.py` module
2. Update the relevant components to use the new module:
   - In `components/visualizations.py`, add option to use phase tracking
   - In `dashboard.py`, update streamgraph generation to use the new implementation
   - In `patient_explorer_page.py`, update individual patient views to show phase transitions

3. Add tests to verify the behavior with real simulation data

## Testing Considerations

When testing the integration:
- Confirm discontinuation rates match simulation statistics
- Verify the total patient count is preserved across all time points
- Check that phase transitions are correctly interpreted
- Ensure compatibility with existing data structures

## Next Steps

After confirming this works for our test data, we can consider:
1. Enhancing the discontinuation type detection (more context for determining discontinuation reason)
2. Adding tooltips to the Streamlit visualization showing phase transition details
3. Further streamlining the phase transition analysis algorithm
