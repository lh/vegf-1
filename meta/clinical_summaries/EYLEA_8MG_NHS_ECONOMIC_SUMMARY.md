# Eylea 8mg NHS Economic Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

Integration of the private repository's economic data reveals that **Eylea 8mg represents a significant NHS budget challenge** despite clinical benefits. Using real NHS procurement costs from the compass_artifact, the analysis shows Eylea 8mg costs £7,000 more per patient annually but offers meaningful clinical and operational advantages.

## Key Findings

### Cost Analysis (Annual, Per Patient)
- **Eylea 8mg q12**: £13,707 (6.1 injections)
- **Eylea 2mg q8**: £6,707 (6.9 injections)  
- **Net difference**: £7,000 more for 8mg

### NHS Drug Procurement Costs (After Patient Access Schemes)
- **8mg formulation**: £1,750 per injection (27% discount from £2,400 list)
- **2mg formulation**: £475 per injection (42% discount from £816 list)
- **Cost premium**: 268% higher drug cost for 8mg

### Clinical Value Propositions
1. **Reduced treatment burden**: 0.8 fewer injections per patient per year
2. **Extended intervals**: 77% maintain q12-16 week dosing vs q8 standard
3. **Superior outcomes**: 63% vs 52% achieve no retinal fluid at week 16
4. **NHS capacity**: 22,400 fewer injection procedures nationally per year

### Budget Impact Analysis
- **Eligible patients**: 65,000 wet AMD patients in UK
- **Potential switchers**: 28,000 (80% of current Eylea users)
- **Annual budget increase**: £196 million
- **Cost per QALY**: £70,000 (assuming 0.1 QALY gain)
- **NICE threshold**: £30,000/QALY ⚠️ **EXCEEDED**

## Cost-Effectiveness Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Optimistic (77% achieve q16 intervals)
- **8mg cost**: £12,252/year (with interval extension savings)
- **vs 2mg**: Still £5,545 more expensive
- **Required QALY gain**: 0.18 to meet NICE threshold

### Scenario 2: Including Patient Benefits
- **Patient time savings**: £80/year (fewer visits)
- **Net NHS+patient cost**: £6,920 more for 8mg
- **Required QALY gain**: 0.23 to meet NICE threshold

### Scenario 3: NHS Capacity Value
- **Procedure capacity value**: £199/year (50% of avoided costs)
- **Demonstrates**: Operational benefits beyond direct costs

## Real-World Safety Considerations

### Intraocular Inflammation (IOI)
- **Clinical trials**: 1% incidence
- **Real-world**: 3.7% incidence per injection
- **Management cost**: £500 per case
- **Annual IOI cost**: £113 (8mg) vs £128 (2mg)
- **Impact**: Minimal difference in safety costs

## Strategic Implications

### For NHS Decision-Makers
1. **Budget pressure**: £196M annual increase threatens affordability
2. **Clinical benefits**: Real but may not justify cost premium
3. **Capacity relief**: 22k fewer procedures valuable for stretched services
4. **Patient convenience**: Significant reduction in treatment burden

### For NICE Technology Appraisal
1. **Cost-effectiveness**: Likely to exceed £30k/QALY threshold
2. **Required evidence**: Demonstrate QALY gains >0.23
3. **Alternative frameworks**: Consider value-based pricing
4. **Patient access schemes**: May need enhanced discounts

### For Economic Modeling
1. **Time horizon**: Extend beyond 1 year to capture long-term benefits
2. **Comparators**: Include ranibizumab biosimilars (£275) and bevacizumab (£28)
3. **Utility gains**: Focus on reduced treatment burden, travel time
4. **Productivity**: Include caregiver and patient time costs

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enhanced economic modeling**: Extend time horizon to 2-5 years
2. **Patient-reported outcomes**: Quantify utility of reduced visits
3. **Comparative analysis**: Model against all available treatments
4. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test key assumptions on costs and outcomes

### Policy Considerations
1. **Managed access**: Consider restricted use in specific patient populations
2. **Risk-sharing**: Explore outcome-based payment schemes
3. **Capacity planning**: Value the reduced NHS procedure burden
4. **Patient choice**: Balance clinical freedom with cost control

### Data Requirements
1. **Long-term efficacy**: 2+ year outcomes data
2. **Real-world evidence**: Post-marketing surveillance on costs
3. **Patient preferences**: Willingness-to-pay for convenience
4. **Health economics**: Comprehensive utility and productivity analysis

## Conclusion

**Eylea 8mg faces significant cost-effectiveness challenges in the NHS setting** despite genuine clinical benefits. The £7,000 annual cost premium requires substantial QALY gains (>0.23) to meet NICE thresholds. However, the reduction in NHS procedure burden and improved patient convenience represent meaningful value that traditional cost-effectiveness analysis may undervalue.

**Success will depend on**: Enhanced patient access schemes, demonstration of long-term benefits, and innovative value-based pricing arrangements that recognize both clinical outcomes and operational efficiencies.
