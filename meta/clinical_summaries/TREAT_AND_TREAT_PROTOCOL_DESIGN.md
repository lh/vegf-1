# Treat-and-Treat Protocol Design

## Overview
A fixed-interval dosing protocol for Eylea (aflibercept) 2mg with predetermined injection schedule and monitoring visits.

## Treatment Schedule

### Loading Phase (Doses 1-3)
- **Dose 1**: Day 0 (baseline)
- **Dose 2**: Days 28-35 after Dose 1 (4-5 weeks)
- **Dose 3**: Days 28-35 after Dose 2 (4-5 weeks)
- **Total loading duration**: 56-70 days (8-10 weeks)

### Maintenance Phase (Dose 4+)
- **Dose 4 onwards**: Every 56-63 days (8-9 weeks)
- **Fixed interval**: No adjustment based on disease activity

## Monitoring Schedule

### Clinical Assessment Visit
- **Timing**: Between Dose 3 and Dose 4
- **Components**:
  - Face-to-face consultation
  - OCT imaging
  - Intraocular pressure check
  - Visual acuity assessment
- **Purpose**: Safety check and disease assessment (but doesn't change treatment schedule)

### Annual Review Visit
- **Timing**: Within 2 weeks of treatment anniversary
- **Frequency**: Yearly
- **Components**: Same as clinical assessment
- **Purpose**: Annual safety review and treatment continuation decision

## Key Protocol Features

1. **Fixed intervals**: No dose modifications based on disease activity
2. **Minimal monitoring**: Only 2 types of monitoring visits
3. **Predictable schedule**: Patients know visit dates in advance
4. **Simplified logistics**: Easier for scheduling and capacity planning
5. **Cost implications**: Fixed number of injections per year (~6-7)

## Comparison to Other Protocols

| Feature | Treat-and-Treat | Treat-and-Extend | PRN |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-----|
| Injection frequency | Fixed | Variable | Variable |
| Monitoring frequency | Low | High | Very high |
| Flexibility | None | High | High |
| Patient burden | Predictable | Variable | High |
| Cost predictability | High | Medium | Low |

## Economic Implications

### Annual Costs (Year 1)
- **Injections**: 6-7 (3 loading + 3-4 maintenance)
- **Monitoring visits**: 2 (clinical assessment + annual review)
- **Total visits**: 8-9

### Annual Costs (Year 2+)
- **Injections**: 6 (fixed q8-9 weeks)
- **Monitoring visits**: 1 (annual review only)
- **Total visits**: 7

## Clinical Considerations

### Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Predictable for patients
- Reduced monitoring burden
- Lower overall visit count

### Disadvantages
- No personalization
- May overtreat stable patients
- May undertreat active patients
- Less responsive to disease changes

## Implementation Notes

1. **Visit windows**: Allow 7-day windows for patient convenience
2. **Missed doses**: Clear protocol for handling delays
3. **Discontinuation**: Only at annual reviews unless safety concerns
4. **Documentation**: Simplified with fixed schedule

This protocol represents a pragmatic approach balancing clinical effectiveness with healthcare system efficiency.
