# Aflibercept Pricing Update - January 2025

## Key Finding
**Aflibercept 8mg is currently CHEAPER than 2mg due to aggressive discounting** - likely a strategic move to drive adoption before biosimilar entry.

## Current Pricing Structure

### List Prices (NHS Drug Tariff)
- **Aflibercept 2mg (Eylea)**: £816 per vial
- **Aflibercept 8mg (Eylea HD)**: £998 per vial

### Actual NHS Prices (Commercial in Confidence)
These are estimates based on widespread market intelligence:

- **Aflibercept 2mg**: 
  - Discount: 44% off list price
  - Actual price: £457 (56% of £816)
  
- **Aflibercept 8mg**: 
  - Discount: 66% off list price (aggressive!)
  - Actual price: £339 (34% of £998)
  - **£118 CHEAPER than 2mg**

### Biosimilar Projections
- **Expected price**: ~50% of current 2mg price
- **Estimated cost**: £229 per vial
- **Timeline**: Imminent market entry

## Strategic Implications

### Why 8mg is Priced Below 2mg
1. **Market capture**: Establish 8mg before biosimilar disruption
2. **Switching incentive**: Make it financially attractive to switch
3. **Volume protection**: Maintain market share against biosimilars
4. **Clinical lock-in**: Once patients stable on 8mg, less likely to switch

### Economic Impact on Protocols

#### Previous Analysis (Incorrect Prices)
- Assumed 8mg at £1,750 vs 2mg at £475
- Showed 8mg was £7,000/year MORE expensive
- Required significant QALY gains to justify

#### Revised Analysis (Correct Prices)
- 8mg at £339 vs 2mg at £457
- 8mg is £118 CHEAPER per injection
- With fewer injections (6.1 vs 6.9), savings compound

#### Annual Drug Cost Comparison
**Eylea 2mg (6.9 injections/year)**: £3,153
**Eylea 8mg (6.1 injections/year)**: £2,068
**Annual drug savings with 8mg**: £1,085

**Biosimilar (6.9 injections/year)**: £1,580
**Still cheaper than 8mg by**: £488/year

## Decision Framework Update

### Choose 8mg Now Because:
- Lower drug cost than 2mg
- Fewer injections needed
- Better interval maintenance (77-79%)
- Total cost savings despite higher list price

### Biosimilar Considerations:
- Will be cheapest option at £229/injection
- But requires more frequent dosing
- Total annual cost difference vs 8mg modest (£488)
- Clinical benefits of extended intervals may justify 8mg

## Key Messages
1. **8mg is NOT a premium product** - it's currently cheaper than 2mg
2. **Strategic pricing** creates win-win: NHS saves money, patients get better intervals
3. **Biosimilar impact** may be less dramatic than expected given 8mg pricing
4. **Cost-effectiveness** of 8mg dramatically improved - likely SAVES money while improving outcomes
