# Staggered Simulation Implementation Complete

## Overview

The staggered simulation functionality has been successfully refactored to use existing Parquet data instead of running separate simulations. This approach transforms patient-relative time data to calendar-time perspective for clinic activity analysis.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Transformation Module (`staggered_data_processor.py`)
- **`transform_to_calendar_view()`**: Transforms patient-relative time to calendar time
- **`generate_enrollment_dates()`**: Creates enrollment patterns (uniform, front-loaded, gradual)
- **`generate_clinic_metrics()`**: Calculates monthly clinic activity metrics
- **`calculate_resource_requirements()`**: Computes FTE and resource needs
- **`aggregate_patient_outcomes_by_enrollment_cohort()`**: Groups outcomes by enrollment period

### 2. Visualization Module (`staggered_visualizations.py`)
- **`create_clinic_activity_timeline()`**: Multi-panel timeline of clinic metrics
- **`create_resource_utilization_chart()`**: FTE requirements and capacity utilization
- **`create_cohort_outcomes_comparison()`**: Outcomes by enrollment cohort
- **`create_phase_distribution_heatmap()`**: Treatment phases over calendar time
- **`create_enrollment_flow_diagram()`**: Patient flow visualization (stub for Sankey)

### 3. Updated Streamlit Page (`pages/staggered_simulation_page.py`)
- Renamed to "Calendar-Time Analysis" to better reflect functionality
- Loads existing Parquet simulation results
- Allows configuration of enrollment patterns
- Provides 5 visualization tabs:
  - Clinic Activity
  - Resource Requirements
  - Patient Outcomes
  - Patient Flow
  - Phase Distribution

### 4. App Integration
- Added "Calendar-Time Analysis" to main navigation
- Imported and integrated the new page properly

## Key Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Simulations**: Uses existing simulation data efficiently
2. **Real-World Perspective**: Shows how clinic activity evolves over calendar time
3. **Resource Planning**: Calculates staffing needs based on visit patterns
4. **Cohort Analysis**: Compares outcomes by enrollment period
5. **Export Capabilities**: All analyses can be exported as CSV

## How It Works

1. User selects an existing Parquet simulation from the dropdown
2. Configures enrollment pattern (uniform, front-loaded, or gradual)
3. Sets enrollment period and analysis options
4. Clicks "Transform to Calendar View"
5. System generates synthetic enrollment dates and transforms all visit times
6. Interactive visualizations show clinic activity from multiple perspectives

## Usage Example

```python
# The transformation process
calendar_visits_df, clinic_metrics_df = transform_to_calendar_view(
    visits_df,
    metadata_df,
    enrollment_pattern="uniform",
    enrollment_months=12
)

# Resource calculation
resources_df = calculate_resource_requirements(
    clinic_metrics_df,
    visits_per_clinician_per_day=20
)
```

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual simulation data
2. Fine-tune enrollment pattern algorithms
3. Add more sophisticated resource planning models
4. Implement the Sankey diagram for patient flow
5. Add predictive analytics for future resource needs

## Technical Notes

- All data remains in Parquet format throughout
- Calendar transformation is done in-memory for performance
- Visualization uses Plotly for interactivity
- Export functionality preserves data fidelity
