## Cost Calculation Rules

### 1. Drug Cost Calculations
- Base cost = net_price Ã— quantity
- Include wastage factor for partial vials
- Apply time-based variations (e.g., biosimilar entry)

### 2. Visit Cost Calculations
- Sum all component costs
- Apply staff time multipliers
- Include facility overhead allocation

### 3. Total Patient Cost
- Sum all drug costs over treatment period
- Sum all visit costs
- Add special event costs if applicable
- Apply any bundle discounts

## Reporting Metrics

### Resource Utilization Metrics

### Cost Analysis Metrics
- Cost per patient per year
- Cost per injection
- Cost breakdown by category
- Cost variation analysis
- Budget impact projection

### Efficiency Metrics
- Cost per vision year saved
- Resource efficiency ratios
- Comparative effectiveness
- Value for money indicators
