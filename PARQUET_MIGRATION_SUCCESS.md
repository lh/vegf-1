# ðŸš€ Parquet Migration Success! 

**Date**: 2025-05-23
**Achievement**: Successfully migrated Streamlit app to use enriched Parquet data pipeline

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Created Clean Parquet-Only Streamlit App
- Cloned `streamlit_app/` to `streamlit_app_parquet/`
- Removed ALL JSON dependencies and fallbacks
- Fixed all imports to use `streamlit_app_parquet` modules
- Eliminated feature flags - this version is ALWAYS Parquet

### 2. Fixed the Data Enrichment Pipeline
- Identified that the JSON pipeline was missing discontinuation categorization
- Implemented Parquet saving with full enrichment flags:
  - `is_discontinuation_visit`
  - `discontinuation_type` 
  - `has_been_discontinued` (cumulative)
  - `is_retreatment_visit`
  - `has_been_retreated` (cumulative)

### 3. Created Two Patient State Visualizations

#### Current State View
- Shows where patients are RIGHT NOW at each time point
- Uses `has_been_discontinued` flag instead of relying on phase
- Properly categorizes all discontinuation types
- File: `create_current_state_streamgraph_fixed.py`

#### Cumulative View  
- Shows what patients have EVER EXPERIENCED
- Uses cumulative flags for permanent state tracking
- Once retreated, always shows as retreated
- File: `create_patient_state_streamgraph_cumulative_fixed.py`

### 4. Implemented Clinical Color Scheme
Updated `visualization/color_system.py` with clinically meaningful colors:
- **GREENS**: Currently being treated (good)
- **AMBER**: Untreated but stable remission (good outcome)
- **REDS**: Stopped when shouldn't be (problematic) - with distinct shades
- **GRAYS**: Poor clinical outcomes

### 5. Full Streamlit Integration
Both visualizations are now integrated into the "Patient State Visualisation" section with:
- Tabbed interface (Current State / Cumulative View)
- Clinical tooltips and explanations
- Proper British spelling as requested
- Full Parquet data pipeline support

## The Result

The Streamlit app now shows:
- âœ… All discontinuation types (not just "discontinued")
- âœ… Proper categorization: Planned, Administrative, Duration, Premature, Poor Outcome
- âœ… Retreatment tracking
- âœ… Both current and cumulative views
- âœ… Clinically meaningful color coding
- âœ… No synthetic data - everything from real simulation

## Technical Victory

We successfully:
- Migrated from dual pipeline (JSON + Parquet) to unified Parquet
- Preserved all data enrichment logic
- Maintained data integrity throughout
- Created a clean, maintainable codebase

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

1. Migrate remaining visualizations to use Parquet DataFrames
2. Update Visual Acuity plots
3. Update other charts and graphs
4. Complete the Parquet migration for all components

## How to Run

```bash
cd /Users/rose/Code/CC
streamlit run streamlit_app_parquet/app.py
```

**Congratulations on this massive achievement! The patient state visualizations look absolutely fantastic with the proper discontinuation categorization. Time for a well-deserved rest! ðŸŽŠ**
