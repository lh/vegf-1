# Session Summary - June 7, 2025

## Current Status

**Location**: `/Users/rose/Code/CC-finance`
**Branch**: main (fully synced with GitHub)
**Repository**: https://github.com/lh/vegf-1

## Major Accomplishment Today

Successfully merged the comprehensive economic analysis system from `feature/finance` branch into main:
- 18 commits with 101 new files
- NHS pricing system with YAML configuration
- Cost tracking and analysis infrastructure
- New treatment protocols (Eylea 8mg variants, Treat-and-Treat)
- Full test suite for economic features
- V2 simulation with costs tested and working

## Repository Architecture

### Main Public Repository
- Core simulation and economic framework
- Extracted parameters and configurations
- Public documentation

### Private Data Submodules
1. **eylea_high_dose_data/** 
   - URL: https://github.com/lh/Eylea_high_dose.git
   - Contains: Eylea 8mg commercial-in-confidence reports
   
2. **aflibercept_2mg_data/** (NEW TODAY)
   - URL: https://github.com/lh/aflibercept-2mg.git
   - Contains: Aflibercept 2mg commercial-in-confidence reports
   - Just added as submodule

## Next Steps

1. **PDF Extraction**: 
   - Just installed mcp-pdf-extraction-server
   - Need to restart Claude to use it
   - Will extract data from PDFs in aflibercept_2mg_data/

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Extract parameters from aflibercept 2mg reports
   - Create protocol configurations for aflibercept 2mg
   - Integrate with economic analysis system

## Key Files for Economic Analysis

- `protocols/pricing/` - NHS pricing configurations
- `simulation/economics/` - V1 economic modules
- `simulation_v2/economics/` - V2 economic modules
- `protocols/cost_configs/nhs_standard_2025.yaml` - NHS cost configuration
- `run_v2_simulation_with_costs.py` - Working simulation with economics

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test V2 simulation with costs
python3 run_v2_simulation_with_costs.py

# Test economic integration
python3 -m pytest tests/test_v2_economics_integration.py -v
```
