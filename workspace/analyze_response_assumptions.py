    print("""
The cost calculator appears to model TWO response groups:

1. OPTIMAL RESPONSE (60% of patients):
   - "No disease activity" / "Stable disease"
   - Follows treat-and-extend protocol
   - Can extend intervals up to maximum
   - Lower injection frequency over time
   
2. SUBOPTIMAL RESPONSE (40% of patients):  
   - "Disease activity" / "Unstable disease"
   - Maintains fixed short intervals
   - Ranibizumab: q4 weeks
   - Others: q8 weeks
   - Higher injection frequency maintained

This is a simplified model compared to clinical reality where:
- Patients can move between states
- There's a spectrum of response, not just binary
- Some patients discontinue treatment
- Vision outcomes aren't explicitly modeled

The 60/40 split suggests that in the real world:
- Only 60% of patients achieve good disease control with T&E
- 40% require intensive fixed-interval treatment
- This explains why real-world injection counts are often higher than ideal T&E
