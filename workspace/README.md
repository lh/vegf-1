# Development Workspace

This directory is your playground for active development work.

## Purpose
- Quick experiments and tests
- Temporary scripts
- Work in progress
- Data exploration
- Anything you're actively working on

## Rules
1. Can be messy - that's what it's for\!
2. Not critical if files get deleted
3. Clean up periodically
4. Move important work to proper directories

## Note
Files here should be temporary. If something becomes important, move it to the appropriate directory according to WHERE_TO_PUT_THINGS.md
