# Heterogeneity Branch Summary

## Branch Status: Experimental Research Only

This branch explored adding patient heterogeneity to the simulation engine based on Seven-UP study data. After extensive development and testing, we concluded that the added complexity is not justified for production use.

## What Was Built

### 1. Heterogeneous Simulation Framework
- `simulation_v2/engines/heterogeneous_abs_engine.py` - Extended ABS engine
- `simulation_v2/core/heterogeneity_config.py` - Configuration system
- `simulation_v2/core/heterogeneity_manager.py` - Patient trajectory management
- `simulation_v2/core/heterogeneous_patient.py` - Patient with hidden factors

### 2. Protocols Developed
- 15 iterations of heterogeneous protocols (v1-v15)
- Protocol v15 achieves Seven-UP correlation (r=0.96) and SD targets
- Located in `simulation_v2/protocols/examples/heterogeneous/`

### 3. Validation Tools
- `simulation_v2/validate_against_clinical_data.py` - Clinical validation
- `simulation_v2/compare_standard_vs_heterogeneous.py` - Engine comparison
- Multiple test scripts for Seven-UP validation

## Key Findings

### Successes
- ✅ Achieved Seven-UP correlation target (0.96 vs 0.97 target)
- ✅ Reasonable SD modeling over time
- ✅ Framework successfully models patient-specific trajectories

### Failures
- ❌ Poor clinical validation (19% match rate)
- ❌ Missing core features (discontinuation, loading phases)
- ❌ Over-engineered for the benefit provided
- ❌ No clear path to UI integration

## Decision: Do Not Merge

**Reasons:**
1. Complexity outweighs benefits
2. Core clinical issues not addressed
3. APE.py simplicity is valuable
4. Same improvements can be achieved more simply

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Keep this branch** as experimental reference
2. **Do not merge** to main
3. **Implement improvements** in main engine as per MAIN_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md:
   - Loading phases
   - Discontinuation logic
   - Response-based vision changes
   - Simple heterogeneity without framework

## Files to Copy to Main

Only these documentation files should go to main:
- `MAIN_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Concrete improvement plan
- `HETEROGENEITY_BRANCH_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- Clinical data files already in main

## Future Research

If heterogeneity modeling becomes critical:
1. Simplify the architecture
2. Focus on specific use cases
3. Build UI integration from the start
4. Validate against multiple clinical datasets
