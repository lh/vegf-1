# Economic Analysis Development

Active development of economic and financial modeling capabilities for the simulation.

## Overview

This directory contains the ongoing work to incorporate comprehensive economic analysis into the simulation platform. This includes drug costs, procedure costs, health economics outcomes, and budget impact modeling.

## Structure

- `planning/` - Planning documents and design specifications
  - ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS_PLANNING.md - Overall economic analysis architecture
  - TDD_ECONOMIC_PLAN.md - Test-driven development approach for economic features

- `implementation/` - Implementation details and progress reports
  - FINANCIAL_SYSTEM_V2_MODERNIZATION_REPORT.md - Modernization of financial components
  - FINANCIAL_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Detailed implementation roadmap

- `tests/` - Test specifications and test data for economic features
  - (Test files will be moved here as development progresses)

## Current Status

This is an active development area focusing on:
1. Cost tracking throughout patient journeys
2. Drug acquisition and administration costs
3. Monitoring and procedure costs
4. Budget impact analysis
5. Cost-effectiveness calculations
6. NHS-specific pricing models

## Integration Plan

Once validated, these components will be integrated into:
- `/ape/economics/` - Core economic modules
- `/protocols/cost_configs/` - Cost configuration files
- Simulation results will include economic outcomes

## Related Work

- See `/research/data_analysis/` for clinical data analysis
- See `/protocols/` for existing protocol definitions
- Cost configurations will follow YAML format defined in planning docs
