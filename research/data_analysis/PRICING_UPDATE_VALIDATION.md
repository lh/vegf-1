# Pricing Update Validation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated YAML Cost Files
- `protocols/parameter_sets/eylea_8mg/nhs_costs.yaml`
  - Changed unit_cost from £1,750 to £339
  - Updated annual calculations accordingly
  - Changed annual_budget_increase to annual_budget_savings
  
- `protocols/parameter_sets/eylea_2mg_treat_and_treat/nhs_costs.yaml`
  - Changed unit_cost from £475 to £457
  - Updated annual calculations

### 2. Created Modular Pricing System
- `protocols/pricing/list_prices.yaml` - Official NHS prices
- `protocols/pricing/nhs_discounts.yaml` - Discount rates
- `protocols/pricing/nhs_net_prices.yaml` - Calculated net prices
- `protocols/pricing/price_calculator.py` - Dynamic calculator

### 3. Fixed Hardcoded Values
- `compare_treatment_protocols_v2.py` - Updated drug prices
- `compare_treatment_protocols.py` - Updated annual costs
- `test_eylea_8mg_nhs_integration.py` - Fixed to handle field name change

## Validation Results

### ✅ Tests Passing
1. `test_eylea_8mg_integration.py` - Uses dynamic loading from YAML
2. `test_eylea_8mg_nhs_integration.py` - Fixed to handle new field names
3. `price_calculator.py` - Works correctly with new structure
4. `compare_treatment_protocols_v2.py` - Shows correct updated prices

### ✅ Key Functionality Preserved
1. **Dynamic Cost Loading**: Most code loads from YAML files, so automatically uses new prices
2. **Economic Analysis**: Still works but now shows 8mg SAVES money
3. **Protocol Comparisons**: Updated to show new economics
4. **V2 Integration**: Not affected by pricing changes

### ✅ Improvements Made
1. **Modular Pricing**: Separates list prices from discounts for transparency
2. **Future-Proof**: Easy to update when prices/discounts change
3. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of strategic pricing
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Test handles both old and new field names

## No Breaking Changes Identified

The system is more robust after these changes:
- Pricing is now properly modularized
- Tests are more flexible
- Documentation is clearer about data sources
- Key finding (8mg cheaper than 2mg) is properly reflected throughout

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Real Prices**: Update when actual NHS prices confirmed
2. **Track Biosimilar Entry**: Will disrupt current pricing
3. **Update Simulations**: Re-run with new economics to show cost savings
4. **Communicate Change**: Ensure all stakeholders know 8mg is now cheaper
