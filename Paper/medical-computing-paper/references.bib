  abstract = {Purpose To investigate the recurrence rate of active macular neovascularization in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) previously followed up in a treat-and-extend (TE) regimen in which treatment had been stopped because of disease stability. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants One hundred five patients with nAMD previously followed up in a TE regimen treated with aflibercept injections. Methods All patients with a dry macula on 3 consecutive visits 12 weeks apart were eligible to participate in the study. Patients were examined at baseline and then monitored for disease recurrence 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after the last injection. Main Outcome Measures The proportion of patients with recurrent disease within 12 months after the last injection. Change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the time of recurrence and after resumed therapy. Results Evidence of recurrent nAMD was seen in 54 of 102 patients (52.9\%) after 12 months of follow-up. The mean time to recurrence after the last injection was 6.7 {\textpm} 2.2 months. The BCVA decreased from 71.7 {\textpm} 10.0 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at baseline to 68.1 {\textpm} 11.1 ETDRS letters at the recurrence (P~= 0.12). After treatment resumed, BCVA increased to 71.4 {\textpm} 10.0 ETDRS letters (P~= not significant compared with baseline). Patients with a pigment epithelial detachment (PED) at baseline showed a 74\% (14/19) recurrence rate compared with 48\% (40/83) in patients without a PED (P {$<$} 0.05). Only 22 of 54 patients (40.7\%) with recurrent disease showed symptoms of visual loss or metamorphopsia. Conclusions Recurrent nAMD is common in previously stable patients for whom anti-VEGF injections have been suspended. It is difficult to predict which patients will experience a recurrence, and most of these patients do not show symptoms in the early stages of reactivation. Long-term follow-up is important, and early detection of recurrent disease can improve the chances for maintained visual function.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study assessed anti--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy intensity and its relationship with visual acuity (VA) change in real-world neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients. Design This retrospective analysis was performed on a large database of aggregated, longitudinal, de-identified electronic medical records from a geographically and demographically diverse sample of patients of United States retina specialists (Vestrum Health Retina Database). Participants Treatment-na{\"i}ve nAMD patients who underwent anti-VEGF injections between January 1, 2012, and October 31, 2016, were eligible if follow-up data were available before October 31,~2017. Methods Age, gender, anti-VEGF treatment type, number of treatments, and VA were extracted from the database. Main Outcome Measure Mean VA change assessed at 1 year and stratified based on number of anti-VEGF injections received over 1 year. Results In this analysis, 49 485 eyes were included. The mean age was 80.9 years, and 64\% were female. Mean baseline VA was 53.8 letters (Snellen equivalent, 20/80). At 1 year, after a mean of 7.3 anti-VEGF injections, there was a mean gain of 1 letter (0.95 letter; 95\% confidence interval [CI] for change in VA,~+0.77 to~+1.13 letter; P {$<$} 0.001). When stratified by anti-VEGF agent, the mean VA changes were nearly identical at 1 year. There was a linear relationship between mean letters gained and mean number of injections, between 4 and 10 injections over 1 year, with 4 or fewer or 10 or more injections associated with loss of vision or a plateau, respectively. Greater mean 1-year change in VA also trended with worse baseline VA; those patients with better VA at presentation tended to be particularly vulnerable to vision loss. Those who received the fewest injections tended to be older and have worse baseline VA. Conclusions Real-world nAMD patients receive fewer anti-VEGF injections and experience worse visual~outcomes compared with patients receiving fixed, frequent therapy in randomized controlled trials. Mean change in VA correlates with treatment intensity at 1 year, but with ceiling effects related to treatment intensity and~baseline VA. Older patients and those with poor baseline VA may be particularly prone to undertreatment.},

  abstract = {Purpose To report the 2-year outcomes of intravitreal aflibercept injections (IAIs) in Japanese patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using a 1-month adjusted treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen. Design Multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. Participants Ninety-seven eyes of 97 patients with treatment-naive AMD were studied at 3 tertiary ophthalmological institutions. Methods The patients were treated with 3 consecutive monthly IAIs followed by the TAE regimen with a 1-month adjustment for a maximum of 3 months. Our TAE regimen allowed us to shorten and extend the treatment intervals even after a 3-month or 1-month treatment interval, or both, were reached. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) were analyzed. Main Outcome Measures The mean changes in the BCVA, CRT, and SCT from the baseline to 2 years after initiating the treatment were determined. In addition, the number of injections also was determined. Results The mean BCVA significantly improved from 0.27 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units to 0.14 logMAR at 2 years (P {$<$} 0.01). The mean CRT decreased significantly from 307{\textpm}132 {$\mu$}m to 202{\textpm}76 {$\mu$}m at 2 years (P {$<$} 0.01). The mean SCT decreased significantly from 247{\textpm}106 {$\mu$}m to 203{\textpm}96 {$\mu$}m at 2 years (P {$<$} 0.01). Seventy eyes (72.2\%) showed a dry macula at 2 years. The treatment interval at 2 years was 1 month in 20 eyes (20.6\%), 2 months in 18 eyes (18.6\%), and 3 months in 59 eyes (60.8\%). In 49 (50.5\%) eyes with a 3-month treatment interval immediately after the loading phase, no fluid was seen in 25 eyes (51.0\%) for the duration of this study. The rest had switched to a more frequent scheme. The mean number of injections during the 2-year period was 13.0{\textpm}3.9. Conclusions Intravitreal aflibercept injections with a 1-month adjusted TAE regimen significantly improved the BCVA and CRT with a reduced number of injections at 2 years. The treatment interval was adjusted to extend to 3 months in 60\% and to shorten to 1 month in 20\% of the eyes at 2 years.},
