This review examines treatments for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), particularly focusing on anti-VEGF agents like aflibercept. It analyzes clinical trial evidence, real-world effectiveness, treatment discontinuation outcomes, and comparative effectiveness between different agents. Additionally, the paper explores computational modeling approaches to simulate and optimize treatment regimens, providing insights into personalized treatment strategies that may improve patient outcomes while reducing treatment burden.
