# Cost Tracking Implementation Status

## Current Status: COMPLETE ✅

The cost tracking functionality has been fully implemented and integrated into the simulation system.

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Core Implementation
- **Enhanced Cost Tracker** with task-based workload tracking
- **Cost-Aware ABS Engine** that extends the standard engine
- **NHS HRG-aligned cost configuration** with accurate pricing
- **Full UI component suite** for configuration and analysis
- **Integration with main Simulations page** (already done in pages/2_Simulations.py)
- **New Cost Analysis page** (pages/5_Cost_Analysis.py)

### 2. Key Design Changes (Per Your Feedback)
- ✅ Switched from personnel-based to task-based tracking
- ✅ Removed interpretive conclusions - just presents data
- ✅ Direct file editing instead of patching scripts
- ✅ Focused on T&E and T&T time-based protocols

### 3. Files Created/Modified
**New files:**
- `/simulation_v2/economics/enhanced_cost_tracker.py`
- `/simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_with_enhanced_costs.py`
- `/ape/components/cost_tracking/` (all UI components)
- `/ape/core/simulation_runner_with_costs.py`
- `/ape/components/simulation_ui_v2_with_costs.py`
- `/pages/5_Cost_Analysis.py`
- `/protocols/cost_configs/nhs_hrg_aligned_2025.yaml`

**Modified:**
- `/pages/2_Simulations.py` - Already has cost tracking integrated!

## What Needs Testing

### Test Scripts Ready
1. **test_cost_ui.py** - Tests UI component imports and basic functionality
2. **test_cost_tracking_protocols.py** - Tests T&E and T&T protocols specifically
3. **verify_cost_tracking_integration.py** - Verifies all components are properly integrated

## Next Steps After Restart

### 1. Run the verification script:
```bash
python verify_cost_tracking_integration.py
```
This will check:
- All imports work correctly
- All files are in place
- Simulations page has cost tracking integrated

### 2. Run the protocol-specific test:
```bash
python test_cost_tracking_protocols.py
```
This will:
- Test both T&E and T&T protocols with cost tracking
- Verify visit type classification works correctly
- Export test data to `output/cost_tracking_test/`

### 3. Run a full simulation with cost tracking:
1. Start Streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Go to Simulations page
3. Select T&E or T&T time-based protocol
4. Enable "Cost Tracking" checkbox
5. Run simulation (start small - 100 patients, 2 years)
6. Go to Cost Analysis page to view results

### 4. Verify key behaviors:
- **T&E**: All visits should be "decision tasks" (full assessments)
- **T&T**: Most visits should be "injection tasks" with annual assessments
- Cost should default to Eylea Biosimilar (£355)
- Workload visualizer should show task distribution
- Data export should work

## Expected Results

### For T&E (Treat & Extend):
- Every visit includes full assessment
- Higher cost per visit (~£599 with biosimilar)
- All visits count as decision tasks
- More consultant/decision-maker time

### For T&T (Treat & Treat):
- Most visits are injection-only (~£529)
- Annual full assessments
- Lower overall decision task count
- Higher injection task count

## If Issues Arise

1. **Import errors**: Check file paths in the error messages
2. **Cost tracking not available**: Verify COST_TRACKING_AVAILABLE is True in Simulations page
3. **No cost data in results**: Ensure "Enable Cost Tracking" was checked before running
4. **Protocol not found**: Use the starred time-based protocols in the UI

## Git Status
All changes have been made directly to files (no patches). Ready to test and then commit if successful.

## Success Criteria
✅ Both test scripts pass
✅ Can run simulation with cost tracking enabled
✅ Cost Analysis page shows data
✅ Workload metrics match protocol expectations
✅ Can export cost and workload data

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
