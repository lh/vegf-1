# Cost Tracking Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully implemented comprehensive cost tracking functionality for the AMD simulation system, focusing on the time-based T&E and T&T protocols.

### Key Components Added

1. **Task-Based Workload Tracking**
   - Replaced personnel-specific tracking with flexible task-based system
   - Tracks: injection tasks, decision tasks, imaging tasks, admin tasks, virtual reviews
   - Allows sites to assign tasks to available staff (consultants, residents, nurse practitioners, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Cost Tracker** (`simulation_v2/economics/enhanced_cost_tracker.py`)
   - Visit type classification system
   - NHS HRG-aligned cost calculations
   - Patient-level cost tracking
   - Monthly workload metrics

3. **Cost-Aware Simulation Engine** (`simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_with_enhanced_costs.py`)
   - Extends ABS engine with cost tracking
   - Determines visit types based on protocol
   - Records costs and workload for each visit

4. **UI Components**
   - Cost Configuration Widget - drug selection and pricing
   - Workload Visualizer - task timeline and resource planning
   - Cost Analysis Dashboard - comprehensive economic analysis

5. **Integration**
   - Updated main Simulations page to optionally support cost tracking
   - New Cost Analysis page (page 5) for viewing results
   - Enhanced simulation runner with cost support

### How to Use

1. **Running a Simulation with Costs:**
   - Go to Simulations page
   - Check "Enable Cost Tracking"
   - Select drug type (default: Eylea Biosimilar Â£355)
   - Run simulation as normal

2. **Viewing Results:**
   - After simulation, go to Cost Analysis page
   - View key metrics, cost breakdowns, workload analysis
   - Export data for further analysis

### Protocol-Specific Behaviors

**T&E (Treat & Extend):**
- Every visit includes full assessment
- Higher cost per visit
- All visits are decision tasks

**T&T (Treat & Treat):**
- Most visits are injection-only
- Quarterly full assessments
- Lower cost per visit

### Files Created/Modified

**New:**
- `/ape/components/cost_tracking/` - all UI components
- `/simulation_v2/economics/enhanced_cost_tracker.py`
- `/simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine_with_enhanced_costs.py`
- `/pages/5_Cost_Analysis.py`

**Modified:**
- `/pages/2_Simulations.py` - added optional cost tracking support
- Various test and documentation files

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use with T&E and T&T time-based protocols. You can now:
1. Run simulations with cost tracking enabled
2. Compare economic outcomes between protocols
3. Use workload data for service planning
4. Export data for commissioning decisions
