# Here are some suggestions to make future sessions more productive:

  1. Add to CLAUDE.md:
    - "For all visualizations, follow Tufte principles documented in meta/visualization_templates.md"
    - "Maintain consistent styling across charts with the established color system"
    - "When modifying Streamlit components, test changes with test scripts before updating the app"
  2. For more productive sessions:
    - If you're looking at a specific feature or bug next time, let me know at the start of the session
    - Consider starting with a short description of what you want to accomplish in the session
    - For complex visualization changes, having a screenshot of the current state and a mockup of the desired state would be
  helpful
  3. Things to investigate next time:
    - We could look at applying the same Tufte-inspired principles to other visualizations in the app
    - We might want to centralize the color system implementation for more consistent usage
    - Creating reusable visualization components could help maintain consistency
