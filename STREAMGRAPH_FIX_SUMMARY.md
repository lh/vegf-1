# Streamgraph and Retreatment Visualization Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address visualization issues in the streamgraph and retreatment visualization components.

## Streamgraph Patient States Fixes

The visualization of patient states in the streamgraph was enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Fixed Patient State Tracking**: 
   - Improved the tracking of patients across various states (Active, Discontinued, Retreated)
   - Properly accounted for all patients in the simulation at all timepoints
   - Fixed state transitions to ensure patient counts are consistent

2. **Retreatment Visualization**:
   - Added dedicated patient states for retreated patients to properly visualize retreatment patterns
   - Implemented retreatment tracking by discontinuation type for better analysis
   - Enhanced coloring system to distinguish between different patient states

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensured patient counts remain consistent throughout the simulation timeline
   - Fixed timestamp conversion for proper month-based visualization
   - Addressed edge cases in timestamp handling across different operating systems

## Integration with Enhanced DES Framework

The visualization improvements were integrated with the enhanced DES framework:

1. **Enhanced DES Implementation**:
   - Configuration-driven protocol parameters for flexible simulation setup
   - Standardized event structure for improved consistency
   - Better tracking of discontinuation and retreatment events

2. **TreatAndExtendAdapter**:
   - Implemented adapter pattern for compatibility with original TreatAndExtendDES
   - Maintained the same interface while using enhanced framework internally
   - Added validation scripts to compare outputs with original implementation

3. **Staggered Enrollment Support**:
   - Added support for staggered patient enrollment with proper time tracking
   - Implemented per-patient timing for more realistic simulation
   - Enhanced per-patient state tracking for better visualization

## Retreatment Panel Improvements

The retreatment panel was updated to better visualize retreatment patterns:

1. **Enhanced Retreatment Visualization**:
   - Added more detailed visualization of retreatment by discontinuation type
   - Improved data presentation with clear labeling and metrics
   - Added explanatory text and context for better interpretation

2. **Data Fallbacks**:
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms when specific data is not available
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing visualization functions
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback

## Usage

To use the fixed streamgraph visualization:

1. Import the `streamgraph_patient_states_fixed.py` module in your script
2. Use the `create_patient_state_streamgraph()` function for general state visualization
3. Use the `visualize_retreatment_by_discontinuation_type()` function for retreatment analysis

The retreatment panel will automatically use the enhanced visualization when available.
