            **Important Notes About Retreatment Statistics**
            
            There's an important distinction between **unique patients** and **retreatment events**:
            
            - **Patients Discontinued**: The count of unique patients who had treatment discontinued
            - **Retreatment Events**: The total number of retreatment events (one patient may have multiple retreatments)
            - **Est. Unique Patients**: Estimated number of unique patients retreated per discontinuation type
            - **Patient Retreatment Rate**: Estimated percentage of discontinued patients who were retreated
            - **Event/Patient Ratio**: Average number of retreatment events per discontinued patient
            
            When the Event/Patient Ratio exceeds 1.0, it means some patients had multiple retreatments.
            This can lead to retreatment event counts exceeding discontinued patient counts.

        ### Retreatment Statistics Explained
        
        In this dashboard, we track both discontinuations and retreatments:
        
        - **Discontinuation**: When a patient stops receiving regular treatment
        - **Retreatment**: When a previously discontinued patient resumes treatment due to disease recurrence
        
        #### Key Metrics:
        
        - **Patient Retreatment Rate**: The percentage of discontinued patients who had at least one retreatment
        - **Event/Patient Ratio**: Average number of retreatment events per patient (can exceed 1.0)
        
        #### Why Rates Can Be High:
        
        High retreatment rates indicate that many discontinued patients eventually needed to resume treatment.
        This may suggest that:
        
        1. The discontinuation criteria may need revision
        2. Monitoring after discontinuation is effectively identifying recurrences
        3. The disease has a natural tendency to recur after treatment cessation
        
        A high Event/Patient ratio (>1.0) indicates that some patients are experiencing multiple retreatments,
        suggesting a cycle of discontinuation and retreatment that might require clinical intervention.
