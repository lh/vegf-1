# AMD Protocol Explorer Monitoring Report

**Date:** May 11, 2025  
**Application URL:** http://localhost:8502  
**Version:** feature/streamlit-dashboard branch

## Executive Summary

The AMD Protocol Explorer Streamlit application was monitored for functionality and possible issues. The application appears to be loading properly, but there were navigation challenges with automated testing. No critical errors or console warnings were detected, though there are informational messages on the dashboard.

## Monitoring Approach

1. **Automated Monitoring:** Used Puppeteer to navigate the application, capture screenshots, and detect issues
2. **Console Log Analysis:** Checked for JavaScript errors and warnings in the browser console
3. **UI Issue Detection:** Scanned the DOM for alert and error messages
4. **Network Request Analysis:** Monitored for failed network requests

## Findings

### General Application State

- **Application Loads:** The application successfully loads at the provided URL
- **UI Rendering:** All UI elements appear to render correctly on the home page
- **Navigation Structure:** Sidebar navigation with tabs for Dashboard, Run Simulation, Staggered Simulation, Patient Explorer, Reports, and About sections

### UI Messages

Two informational messages were detected:

1. **Implementation Information:**
   ```
   Using Fixed Discontinuation Implementation
   This app is using the fixed discontinuation implementation that properly tracks
   unique patient discontinuations and prevents double-counting.
   The discontinuation rates shown will be accurate (â‰¤100%).
   ```

2. **Simulation Status:**
   ```
   No simulation results available. Please run a simulation to view results.
   ```

### Console Logs

Only one informational console log message was detected:
```
Gather usage stats: false
```

### Network Requests

No failed network requests were detected during monitoring.

### Navigation

Automated navigation between different sections of the application encountered challenges:

- **Issue:** Difficulty programmatically clicking on radio button navigation elements
- **Impact:** Navigation needs to be performed manually or requires specialized selectors
- **Root Cause:** Streamlit's dynamic DOM rendering and event handling

### Simulation Testing

Simulation testing was not completed automatically due to navigation challenges. Manual testing is recommended to:

1. Run a simulation with various parameters
2. Verify visualization rendering
3. Check data correctness in the output

## Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing of the simulation functionality
2. **Streamlit Integration Tests:** Consider adding Streamlit-specific integration tests using their recommended testing approach
3. **Navigation Helpers:** Add data-test-id attributes to key UI elements to improve testability
4. **Monitoring Schedule:** Set up regular monitoring to catch potential issues early

## Screenshots

A collection of screenshots was captured during monitoring, showing the initial application state and various pages. These are stored in the `screenshots/monitoring` directory.

## Next Steps

1. Complete manual testing of simulation functionality
2. Verify visualization rendering and data accuracy
3. Test edge cases with extreme parameter values
4. Validate all navigation paths through the application
