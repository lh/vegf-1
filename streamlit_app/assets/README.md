# APE: AMD Protocol Explorer Assets

This directory contains assets used by the APE application.

## Logo Files

### ape_logo.jpg

Place your APE logo file named `ape_logo.jpg` in this directory to have it automatically displayed in the application.

The app is configured to look for this specific filename in this location.

## Changing the Logo

If you want to use a different image file:

1. Save your logo image in this directory
2. Update the file path in `app.py` to match your new filename
3. If using an SVG file instead of JPG, update the file extension in the code

## Logo Requirements

For best results:

- Use a square or nearly square aspect ratio
- Use an image with some transparent background space for better appearance
- Recommended dimensions: 400x400 pixels or larger
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG (preferred for transparency), or SVG
