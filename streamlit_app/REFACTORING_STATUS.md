# Refactoring Status Report

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented the core architecture and several key components of the refactored application:

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Core Architecture**:
   - âœ… Directory structure (pages, components, utils, models)
   - âœ… Layout components
   - âœ… Visualization system with caching for reports
   - âœ… Error handling utilities
   - âœ… Session state management

2. **Visualization System**:
   - âœ… Visualization caching system
   - âœ… Export functionality for different formats
   - âœ… R integration with progressive enhancement
   - âœ… Matplotlib-based visualizations

3. **Data Models**:
   - âœ… Simulation results models
   - âœ… Report data structures

4. **Pages and UI Components**:
   - âœ… Dashboard page
   - âœ… Run Simulation page
   - âœ… Reports page
   - âœ… About page

5. **App Router**:
   - âœ… Main entry point that routes to individual pages
   - âœ… Error handling and graceful degradation

### ðŸš§ In Progress

1. **Page Extraction**:
   - ðŸš§ Staggered Simulation page
   - ðŸš§ Patient Explorer page

2. **Model Completion**:
   - ðŸš§ Parameters data model
   - ðŸš§ Validation utilities

3. **Testing**:
   - ðŸš§ Test plan
   - ðŸš§ Unit tests
   - ðŸš§ Integration tests

## Running the Refactored Application

To run the refactored application:

```bash
cd /Users/rose/Code/CC
streamlit run streamlit_app/app_refactored.py
```

The application will run with the implemented pages (Dashboard, Run Simulation, Reports, and About). The other pages (Staggered Simulation and Patient Explorer) will show error messages until they are implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Extract Remaining Pages**:
   - Extract Staggered Simulation page (lines 709-989 in original app.py)
   - Extract Patient Explorer page (lines 990-1073 in original app.py)

2. **Implement Utilities**:
   - Create config.py for application configuration
   - Finish remaining data models

3. **Testing**:
   - Create a test plan document
   - Implement unit tests for core components
   - Test the entire application

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with information about the refactored architecture
   - Add docstrings to all modules, classes, and functions

5. **Deployment**:
   - After thorough testing, rename app_refactored.py to app.py
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Benefits of the Refactored Architecture

The refactored architecture provides several key benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files with clear responsibilities
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new pages and features
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different pages
4. **Performance**: Visualization caching improves performance
5. **User Experience**: Progressive enhancement provides immediate feedback
6. **Report Generation**: High-quality visualizations for reports

## Implementation Guide

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on completing the remaining components.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Enable debug mode in the sidebar for more information
3. Look for missing files or dependencies
4. Ensure all directories are created correctly

## Known Issues

- Some imports may fail if certain modules are not yet implemented
- The R integration requires R and ggplot2 to be installed
- Error handling may not catch all edge cases
