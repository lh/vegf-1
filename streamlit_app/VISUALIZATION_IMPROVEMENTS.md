# Visualization Improvements

We've enhanced the visualizations in the Streamlit app with the following improvements:

## 1. Fixed R Integration

- Fixed command-line argument passing to R script
- Added detailed debugging output
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Enhanced Streamlit cache invalidation for visualization updates

## 2. Enhanced Visualizations

### Enrollment Visualization
- Added a smooth trend line to highlight enrollment patterns
- Improved color scheme with semi-transparent bars
- Enhanced axis formatting and labeling

### Visual Acuity Visualization
- Added confidence interval bands around the trend line
- Included reference line for baseline visual acuity
- Enhanced point and line styling for better readability
- Improved y-axis scaling based on data range

## 3. Debugging Tools

- Added `direct_r_test.py` for testing R visualization without Streamlit
- Enhanced debug panels in the application when debug mode is enabled
- Added visualization file inspection and direct viewing in debug mode
- Improved logging to both console and file

## Using Debug Mode

To access enhanced debugging features:
1. Toggle on the "Debug Mode" switch in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the Staggered Simulation page
3. Run a simulation
4. Expand the debug panels to see detailed information
5. Check the log file at: `/tmp/streamlit_app.log` or the temp directory shown in debug output

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any visualization issues:
1. Enable debug mode
2. Take screenshots of the debug panels
3. Share the log file contents
4. Note which visualization type is problematic
