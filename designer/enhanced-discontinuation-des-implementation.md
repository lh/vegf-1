# Enhanced Discontinuation DES Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the enhanced discontinuation model for the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) system. It addresses the issues with discontinuation statistics in the original implementation and explains the refactoring approach to ensure accurate tracking of patient discontinuations.

## Problem Description

The original DES implementation suffered from the following issues related to discontinuation:

1. **Double Counting**: The `evaluate_discontinuation()` method was being called twice for each discontinuation decision, which could lead to statistics being updated multiple times for the same patient.

2. **Missing Enabled Flag**: The "enabled" flag in the discontinuation configuration was defaulting to `False` when not explicitly set, causing discontinuations to never occur in some simulation runs.

3. **Inconsistent Tracking**: There was no distinction between unique patient discontinuations and total discontinuation events, leading to discontinuation rates exceeding 100% in some cases.

4. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: The discontinuation manager both made decisions about discontinuation and updated statistics, violating separation of concerns principles.

## Implementation Approach

The refactoring follows the same approach used for the ABS implementation, with a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Decision Logic vs. State Changes**: Separate the decision of whether a patient should discontinue from the action of actually discontinuing the patient and updating statistics.

2. **Pure Functions**: Implement decision functions that don't update state or statistics, making them easier to test and reason about.

3. **Explicit Tracking**: Track unique discontinued patients separately from total discontinuation events to ensure accurate rates.

4. **Single Evaluation**: Ensure each discontinuation decision is made only once per patient visit, eliminating double counting.

5. **Proper Registration**: Register discontinuations and retreatments only after the patient's state has actually been changed, ensuring counts are accurate.

## Key Changes in DES Implementation

### 1. Refactored Discontinuation Manager

The `RefactoredDiscontinuationManager` class provides:

- **Pure Decision Functions**: `evaluate_discontinuation()` and `evaluate_retreatment()` return decisions without side effects
- **Registration Methods**: `register_discontinuation()` and `register_retreatment()` update statistics after state changes
- **Unique Tracking**: Uses sets to track unique patients that have been discontinued or retreated
- **Compatibility Layer**: A wrapper class preserves the original interface for backward compatibility

### 2. Fixed DES Implementation

The `TreatAndExtendDES` class in `treat_and_extend_des_fixed.py` implements:

- **Single Evaluation**: Only calls `evaluate_discontinuation()` once per patient visit
- **Explicit Registration**: Calls `register_discontinuation()` after actually updating patient state
- **Consistent Tracking**: Maintains sets of discontinued and retreated patients for accurate unique counts
- **Improved Statistics**: Distinguishes between unique discontinuations and total discontinuation events

### 3. Configuration Handling

- **Explicit Enabled Flag**: Always sets the `enabled` flag to `True` in the configuration
- **Properly Structured Config**: Creates a properly structured configuration dictionary for the discontinuation manager

## Verification

The changes have been verified through:

1. **Explicit Testing**: A dedicated test script (`test_fixed_des.py`) verifies:
   - Discontinuations occur at the expected rate
   - No double counting is happening
   - Discontinuation rates are plausible (â‰¤100%)
   - Stats are consistent between simulation and manager

2. **Statistical Validation**: The implementation tracks and compares:
   - Unique discontinued patients
   - Total discontinued events
   - Unique retreated patients
   - Discontinuation rates as a percentage of total patients

## Integration

The fixed DES implementation can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original implementation by:

1. Importing from `treat_and_extend_des_fixed` instead of `treat_and_extend_des`
2. Using the new `TreatAndExtendDES` class
3. Relying on the same interface and configuration parameters

## Future Work

1. **Complete Migration**: Once both ABS and DES implementations are confirmed to work correctly, consider removing the compatibility layer and fully migrating to the new interface.

2. **Unification**: Create a common interface for discontinuation handling across both ABS and DES implementations to ensure consistent behavior.

3. **Test Coverage**: Expand test coverage to include a wider range of scenarios, including various discontinuation criteria and clinician influences.

4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to explain how discontinuation works and what the statistics mean.

5. **Streamlit Integration**: Update the Streamlit app to properly handle the refactored discontinuation statistics.
