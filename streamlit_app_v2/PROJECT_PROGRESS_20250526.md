## Technical Achievements Today

### CSS Mysteries Solved üé®
- Streamlit button red text: Target `<p>` tags inside buttons with `!important`
- Popover styling: Include `div.stPopover button` in selectors

- Chevron removal: `div.stPopover svg { display: none !important; }`

### Key Code Patterns Established
- Session state for UI persistence
- Strategic `st.rerun()` for dynamic layouts
- Container wrapping for CSS targeting
- Proper YAML serialization/deserialization

## Immediate Next Steps

2. Add calendar-time transformation
3. Create resource tracking dashboard
4. Build comparison view framework
5. Integrate real cohort mortality data

## Future Considerations
- Multi-center deployment
