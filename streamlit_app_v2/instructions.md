## üöÄ Current Phase: Staggered Enrollment Implementation - Ready for Phase 4

### Overview
The V2 simulation engines currently implement unrealistic instant recruitment where all patients exist from day 0. This needs to be replaced with proper staggered enrollment as was implemented in V1. The rectangular streamgraph shape revealed this issue - all patients are created at simulation start with only initial visits staggered across the first month.

**Phase 1 Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-01-13) - Core engine changes implemented
**Phase 2 Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-01-13) - Data pipeline updated
**Phase 3 Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-06-13) - Streamgraph shows wedge shape
**Current Task**: Phase 4 - UI Integration for recruitment modes
**Timeline**: 7-10 days total (3 phases complete, ~2-4 days remaining)
**Approach**: Replace instant recruitment entirely (no real-world use case)

### üìç Key Documents
- **V1 Implementation Reference**: `/simulation/staggered_abs.py` - Working staggered enrollment
- **Issue Discovery**: Streamgraph showed constant patient totals instead of wedge shape
- **Root Cause**: `simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine.py` lines 119-124, `des_engine.py` lines 108-116

### Key Principle
**All patients must have an enrollment date** - this is when they enter the simulation, not just when they have their first visit. The simulation represents a continuous real-world scenario where patients arrive throughout the entire simulation period.

### Recruitment Modes to Implement

Two mutually exclusive modes (user chooses one):

1. **Fixed Total Mode**
   - User specifies: Total number of patients
   - System calculates: Arrival rate spread evenly across entire simulation duration
   - Example: 1000 patients over 2 years = ~9.6 patients/week
   - Display: "Expected rate: X patients/week"

2. **Constant Rate Mode**  
   - User specifies: Patients per week (or month)
   - System calculates: Expected total based on simulation duration
   - Example: 10 patients/week for 2 years = ~1040 patients (varies due to Poisson)
   - Display: "Expected total: ~X patients"

- [x] Ensure visit times are relative to enrollment
- [x] Test data integrity with small simulations
- [x] Verify late enrollees are handled correctly
- [x] Implement strict type checking (datetime vs int days)
- [x] Fix timing bug where first visits occurred before enrollment

#### Phase 3: Fix Streamgraph (1 day) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Add check: `if enrollment_time <= time_point`
- [x] Verify streamgraph shows wedge shape (growing patient count)
- [x] Test with both calendar and patient time views

#### Phase 4: UI Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Add recruitment mode radio buttons to Simulations page
- [ ] Add conditional inputs (total vs rate)
- [ ] Calculate and display derived value
- [ ] Wire parameters to simulation engines
- [ ] Add help text explaining the modes

#### Phase 5: Analysis Enhancement (2-3 days)
- [ ] Add enrollment statistics section to Analysis Overview
- [ ] Create enrollment distribution histogram
- [ ] Show actual vs expected enrollment rate
- [ ] Add cohort analysis (monthly enrollment groups)
- [ ] Ensure all visualizations handle varying sample sizes

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### Unit Tests:
1. Test Poisson arrival generation
2. Test enrollment date tracking
3. Verify conservation of patient counts
4. Test late enrollee handling

### Visual Validation:
1. Streamgraph shows continuous growth (no plateau)
2. Patient Explorer shows different enrollment dates
3. Analysis statistics match expected distributions
4. All existing visualizations continue working

### Red Flags:
- Constant patient totals (rectangular streamgraph)
- All patients starting at day 0
- Missing enrollment dates in data
- Performance degradation

## üìè Implementation Rules

1. **Replace, Don't Add** - Remove instant recruitment entirely
2. **Real-World Behavior** - Continuous enrollment throughout simulation
3. **No Special Cases** - Late enrollees just have fewer visits
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Old simulations show warning banner
5. **Performance** - May actually improve by spreading patient creation

## üîß Key Code Locations

### Files to Modify:
- `simulation_v2/engines/abs_engine.py` - Core enrollment logic
- `simulation_v2/engines/des_engine.py` - Core enrollment logic
- `simulation_v2/core/patient.py` - Add enrollment_date field
- `core/storage/writer.py` - Include enrollment in Parquet
- `components/treatment_patterns/time_series_generator.py` - Fix patient counting
- `pages/2_Simulations.py` - Add recruitment mode UI
- `pages/3_Analysis.py` - Add enrollment statistics

### Code to Reuse from V1:
```python
# From V1 patient_generator.py
inter_arrival_times = np.random.exponential(1.0 / self.rate_per_day, size=estimated_patients)
arrival_times = np.cumsum(inter_arrival_times)
```

**Remember**: This fixes the "original sin" discovered during streamgraph implementation. The rectangular shape revealed that all patients start at day 0, which is unrealistic for clinical simulations.
