# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 of the memory-aware architecture has been successfully completed. The foundation is now in place for automatically selecting between in-memory and disk-based storage based on simulation size.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Core Architecture ✅
Created the base infrastructure in `/core/`:
- `results/base.py` - Abstract `SimulationResults` base class
- `results/memory.py` - `InMemoryResults` implementation (current behavior)
- `results/parquet.py` - `ParquetResults` implementation (disk-based storage)
- `results/factory.py` - `ResultsFactory` for automatic storage selection

### 2. Memory Monitoring ✅
- `monitoring/memory.py` - Real-time memory tracking with psutil
- Warnings at 500MB, critical at 700MB
- Memory cleanup utilities
- Function decorators for memory profiling

### 3. Integration Layer ✅
- `simulation_adapter.py` - Bridge between V2 engine and memory-aware results
- Backward compatibility with existing code
- Automatic storage tier selection

### 4. Testing ✅
- Comprehensive test suite in `tests/memory/`
- All 6 tests passing
- Covers both storage tiers and factory logic

## Key Features

### Automatic Storage Selection
```python
# Small simulation → In-memory
runner.run(engine_type="abs", n_patients=100, duration_years=2.0)
# Storage: memory, Memory usage: 0.3 MB

# Large simulation → Parquet
runner.run(engine_type="abs", n_patients=5000, duration_years=5.0)
# Storage: parquet, Memory usage: 1.0 MB
```

### Memory Monitoring
```python
monitor = MemoryMonitor()
info = monitor.get_memory_info()
# Current memory: 110.4 MB
# Available: 16977.6 MB
# Status: ✅ Memory usage: 110MB
```

### Unified Interface
Both storage types implement the same interface:
- `get_patient_count()`
- `get_vision_trajectory_df()`
- `iterate_patients(batch_size=100)`
- `save()` / `load()`

## Architecture Diagram

```
SimulationResults (abstract)
├── InMemoryResults
│   ├── All data in RAM
│   ├── Fast access
│   └── Limited by memory
└── ParquetResults
    ├── Data on disk
    ├── Minimal RAM usage
    └── Handles 100K+ patients

ResultsFactory
├── Checks simulation size
├── Creates appropriate type
└── Threshold: 10K patient-years
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is ready. Phase 2 will enhance Parquet integration:
1. Chunked writing with progress bars
2. Lazy loading iterators
3. Summary statistics caching
4. Fast patient lookup index

## Usage Example

```python
from simulation_v2.protocols.protocol_spec import ProtocolSpecification
from core.simulation_adapter import MemoryAwareSimulationRunner

# Load protocol
spec = ProtocolSpecification.from_yaml("protocols/eylea.yaml")

# Create memory-aware runner
runner = MemoryAwareSimulationRunner(spec)

# Run simulation - storage automatically selected
results = runner.run(
    engine_type="abs",
    n_patients=5000,
    duration_years=5.0,
    seed=42
)

# Access data through unified interface
print(f"Storage: {results.metadata.storage_type}")
print(f"Patients: {results.get_patient_count()}")
```

## Integration Status

- ✅ Core architecture complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Example working
- ⏳ Not yet integrated into Streamlit app (next phase)

The memory-aware architecture is ready for integration into the main application.
