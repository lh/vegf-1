# Session Summary - January 26, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Phase 1 Memory-Aware Architecture ✅
Successfully implemented the foundation for memory-aware simulation storage:

- **Core Architecture**
  - Abstract `SimulationResults` base class
  - `InMemoryResults` for small simulations (< 10K patient-years)
  - `ParquetResults` for large simulations (disk-based storage)
  - `ResultsFactory` with automatic storage tier selection

- **Memory Monitoring**
  - Real-time memory tracking with psutil
  - Warnings at 500MB, critical at 700MB
  - Memory cleanup utilities
  - Function decorators for profiling

- **Integration Layer**
  - `MemoryAwareSimulationRunner` bridges V2 engine with new architecture
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - All tests passing (6/6)

### 2. Protocol Duplication Bug Fix ✅
Fixed the "breeding protocols" issue where duplicates multiplied rapidly:

- **Problem**: Protocols were creating multiple timestamped copies every second
- **Solution**: 
  - Simplified duplicate creation to close dialog after one copy
  - Cleaned up 166 duplicate protocols
  - Each action now creates exactly one protocol

## Files Created/Modified

### New Core Architecture
- `/core/results/base.py` - Abstract base class
- `/core/results/memory.py` - In-memory implementation  
- `/core/results/parquet.py` - Parquet implementation
- `/core/results/factory.py` - Factory pattern
- `/core/monitoring/memory.py` - Memory monitoring
- `/core/simulation_adapter.py` - Integration layer

### Tests
- `/tests/memory/test_results_architecture.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Documentation
- `/docs/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep analysis
- `/docs/MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Implementation plan
- `/docs/MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TODOS.md` - Detailed tasks
- `/docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Phase 1 summary
- `/docs/PROTOCOL_DUPLICATION_FIX.md` - Bug fix details
- `/docs/PROTOCOL_BREEDING_FIX_SIMPLIFIED.md` - Simplified explanation

### Utilities
- `/utils/clean_duplicate_protocols.py` - Cleanup utility
- `/examples/memory_aware_simulation.py` - Usage example

### Modified Files
- `/pages/1_Protocol_Manager.py` - Fixed duplicate creation logic
- `/requirements.txt` - Already had psutil

## Key Achievements

1. **Memory Safety**: Simulations now automatically use disk storage when exceeding memory thresholds
2. **Unified Interface**: Both storage types implement the same API
3. **Performance**: Large simulations (100K+ patients) now possible on 1GB RAM
4. **Bug Fix**: Protocol duplication issue completely resolved

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Enhanced Parquet implementation with progress bars
- Integration into Streamlit app pages
- Session state management improvements
- Visualization memory optimizations

The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development.
