# Current Status Summary - May 27, 2025

## Where We Are

We're working on the **Memory-Aware Architecture** for APE V2, which will allow it to run on Streamlit Cloud's 1GB free tier while handling 100K+ patient simulations.

### ‚úÖ Completed (Phases 1-2)

#### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure
- Created two-tier results system (InMemoryResults vs ParquetResults)
- Added memory monitoring with real-time display
- Set up regression test suite
- Automatic storage selection based on simulation size

#### Phase 2: Parquet Integration 
- Implemented chunked Parquet writing with progress bars
- Created lazy loading reader with batch iteration
- Built simulation registry tracking all saved simulations
- Integrated with Streamlit UI showing storage type and memory usage
- Fixed critical bug where only 5,000 of 10,000 patients were being saved

#### Additional Improvements (Last 2 Days)
- Fixed all failing tests after Phase 2 implementation
- Fixed UI bug with `style_axis()` parameter
- Added regression tests to catch UI issues
- **Major Performance Improvements**:
  - Removed unnecessary sampling from histograms (now shows ALL patients)
  - Vectorized treatment interval calculations (112x faster!)
  - Added caching to expensive operations
  - All visualizations now load instantly

### üìç Current State
- Memory-aware architecture is working
- Performance is excellent (you said "I am very happy with the performance now")
- All tests passing
- UI is responsive and accurate

## üéØ Next: Phase 3 - State Management

According to the plan, Phase 3 focuses on:

### 1. Session State Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup of old results
- Memory-aware cache limits
- State size monitoring

### 2. Simulation Registry Enhancement
- File-based simulation browser
- Multi-tab coordination
- Access tracking and cleanup

### 3. Checkpoint System
- Save progress during long simulations
- Recovery after crashes
- Resume interrupted simulations

## üìã Remaining Phases

### Phase 4: Visualization Adaptation
- Batch-aware charts for huge datasets
- Pre-computed statistics
- Memory-efficient plotting

### Phase 5: Production Robustness
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization
- Streamlit Cloud testing

## ü§î Decision Point

We could:
1. **Continue with Phase 3** - Implement state management features
2. **Jump to urgent needs** - If there's something specific you need working
3. **Polish what we have** - More testing, documentation, UI improvements
4. **Deploy and test** - Try current version on Streamlit Cloud
