# Sankey Visualization Integration Summary

## Date: May 31, 2025

### Overview
Successfully integrated enhanced Sankey diagram visualizations into the Analysis Overview page's Treatment Patterns tab, building on the experimental work from the `experiments/` folder.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Integration into Analysis Overview**
- Replaced basic histogram in Treatment Patterns tab with comprehensive sub-tabbed interface
- Now shows Sankey flow diagrams as the primary visualization (first sub-tab)
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding new visualizations

#### 2. **Enhanced Tab Structure**
The Treatment Patterns tab now contains 4 sub-tabs in order:
1. **üåä Treatment Flow Analysis** (Sankey diagrams) - PRIMARY VIEW
2. **üìà Interval Distributions** 
3. **üîç Pattern Details**
4. **üìä Summary Statistics** (original histogram moved here)

#### 3. **Sankey Visualization Features**
Three visualization styles available:
- **Basic**: Grayscale flow diagram
- **Source-Coloured**: Flows inherit colour from their origin state
- **Semantic Colours**: Flows coloured by transition type (blue=intensifying, green=stable, yellow=gap developing, etc.)

#### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**

##### British English Consistency
- Changed all user-visible text from American to British spellings:
  - "Colors" ‚Üí "Colours"
  - "Visualization" ‚Üí "Visualisation"
  - "Gray" ‚Üí "Grey"

##### Layout Optimizations
- Reduced Sankey height from 800px to 600px for better viewport fit
- Moved colour legend from right side to below chart (prevents cutoff)
- Tightened margins for more efficient space usage
- Increased label font size from 10px to 12px for better readability

##### Mobile Experience
- Added automatic mobile device detection
- Shows friendly warning on mobile devices
- Provides mobile-friendly export options and alternatives
- Points users to text-based Pattern Details tab for mobile viewing

##### User-Friendly Messages
- Replaced terse "No data" warnings with helpful explanations
- Explains WHY there might be no transitions (short simulation, few patients)
- Provides actionable suggestions (run longer, more patients)
- Uses encouraging tone with üìä emoji consistency

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
1. `pages/3_Analysis_Overview.py`
   - Integrated `render_enhanced_treatment_patterns_tab()` function
   - Removed inline histogram code

2. `components/treatment_patterns/enhanced_tab.py`
   - Reordered sub-tabs to show Sankey first
   - Added mobile detection and warnings
   - Improved all "no data" messages
   - Fixed import issues

3. `components/treatment_patterns/__init__.py`
   - Added missing `calculate_interval_statistics` export

4. `components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder.py`
   - Fixed British English in all user-visible text
   - Adjusted layout parameters for better display
   - Moved legend position to prevent cutoff

### Data Integrity
- Maintained principle of showing only active session data
- Rejected auto-loading of saved simulations (scientific integrity)
- All visualizations use real simulation data only

### Testing Considerations
- Sankey visualizations require sufficient data (2+ years, 100+ patients recommended)
- Short simulations may not show transitions
- Mobile users directed to alternative views

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing simplified mobile export in future
- Monitor user feedback on visualization clarity
- Potential for additional transition analysis features

### Key Lessons
1. Complex visualizations need thoughtful mobile handling
2. User messaging is crucial when data requirements aren't met
3. British English consistency matters for professional appearance
4. Layout adjustments significantly impact usability
