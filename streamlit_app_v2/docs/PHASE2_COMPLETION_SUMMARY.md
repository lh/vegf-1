# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 of the memory-aware architecture has been successfully completed! We now have a fully functional Parquet-based storage system with lazy loading, progress tracking, and Streamlit integration.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Chunked Parquet Writing ‚úÖ
- `ParquetWriter` class with configurable chunk size (default 5000 records)
- Progress callbacks showing percentage and current operation
- Efficient append mode for large datasets
- Proper schema handling (fixed index column issue)

### 2. Lazy Loading Reader ‚úÖ
- `ParquetReader` class with iterator-based access
- Batch reading to minimize memory usage
- Fast patient lookup with filters
- Pre-computed metadata caching
- Patient index creation for optimized queries

### 3. Simulation Registry ‚úÖ
- Track all saved simulations with metadata
- Automatic cleanup of old simulations (max 50)
- Access tracking and sorting options
- Export summaries as DataFrames

### 4. Streamlit Integration ‚úÖ
- Updated Run Simulation page to use `MemoryAwareSimulationRunner`
- Memory monitoring in sidebar with real-time updates
- Storage type display (Memory vs Parquet)
- Memory usage warnings before simulation
- Efficient patient stats calculation using iterators

### 5. Progress Indicators ‚úÖ
- Console progress during Parquet writing
- Streamlit progress bar during simulation
- Memory optimization suggestions

## Key Features

### Automatic Storage Selection
```python
# Small simulation (< 10K patient-years) ‚Üí Memory
Storage: Memory, Usage: 0.6 MB

# Large simulation (> 10K patient-years) ‚Üí Parquet  
Storage: Parquet, Usage: 1.0 MB
  [  0%] Preparing patient data...
  [ 50%] Writing visit data...
  [100%] Complete!
```

### Memory Monitoring in UI
- Real-time memory usage in sidebar
- Color-coded warnings (green/yellow/red)
- Progress bar showing usage vs limit
- Detailed breakdown in expander

### Efficient Data Access
```python
# Iterate patients in batches without loading all
for patient_batch in results.iterate_patients(batch_size=100):
    process_batch(patient_batch)

# Get specific patient efficiently
patient = results.get_patient("patient_123")

# Lazy vision trajectories
for trajectory_batch in reader.get_vision_trajectories_lazy():
    plot_batch(trajectory_batch)
```

## Testing

All 12 tests passing:
- 6 Phase 1 tests (base architecture)
- 6 Phase 2 tests (Parquet integration)

## Performance

- **Writing**: 1000 patients in ~1 second with progress tracking
- **Reading**: Lazy iteration keeps memory constant at ~1MB
- **Queries**: Fast patient lookup using Parquet filters
- **UI**: Responsive even with large simulations

## Next Steps

Phase 3 will focus on state management:
- Session state cleanup
- Multi-tab coordination
- Checkpoint system for crash recovery
- Simulation result browser

## Usage Example

Running a large simulation now shows:

```
üìÅ Using Parquet storage for 5,000 patients √ó 5.0 years
  [  0%] Preparing patient data...
  [ 25%] Processing patients: 1,250/5,000
  [ 50%] Writing visit data...
  [ 75%] Processing visits: 3,750/5,000 patients  
  [ 95%] Finalizing metadata...
  [100%] Complete!

Storage Type: Parquet
Memory Usage: 1.0 MB
Scale: 25,000 patient-years
```

The memory-aware architecture is now fully operational with efficient disk-based storage!
