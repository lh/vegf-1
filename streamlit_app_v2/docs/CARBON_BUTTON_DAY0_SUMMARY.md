# Carbon Button Migration - Day 0 Summary

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### 1. Feature Branch Setup ✅
- Created `feature/carbon-buttons` branch off main
- Set up tracking with remote repository

### 2. Test Infrastructure ✅
- Created comprehensive Playwright test structure
- Set up test configuration for multiple browsers
- Created helper classes for Streamlit-specific testing
- Added visual regression, accessibility, and performance test suites

### 3. Carbon Button Compatibility ✅
- Verified compatibility with Streamlit 1.45.1
- Created isolated test environment
- Confirmed Carbon button imports work correctly
- Created test app demonstrating all button types

### 4. Test Files Created ✅

```

### 5. Setup Scripts ✅
- `setup-playwright.sh` - Installs Playwright and browsers
- `run-baseline-tests.sh` - Runs all baseline tests
- `test_carbon_compatibility.py` - Verifies Carbon button compatibility

### 6. Project Configuration ✅
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and test scripts
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `.gitignore` - Excludes test artifacts

## 📋 Next Steps (Day 1)

1. **Run Baseline Tests**
   ```bash
   ./setup-playwright.sh
   ./run-baseline-tests.sh
   ```

2. **Review Reports**
   - Button inventory in `tests/playwright/reports/button-inventory.md`
   - Baseline metrics in `tests/playwright/reports/`
   - Visual baselines in `tests/playwright/screenshots/`

3. **Begin Implementation**
   - Create `utils/carbon_button_helpers.py`
   - Create test comparison page
   - Start migrating navigation buttons

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Compatibility**: Streamlit 1.45.1 fully supports streamlit-carbon-button
- **Test Coverage**: All button types have baseline tests ready
- **Documentation**: Migration tracker created at `docs/CARBON_BUTTON_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md`

## 📊 Test Infrastructure Benefits

1. **TDD Approach**: Tests exist before any migration starts
2. **Visual Regression**: Screenshots will catch any UI changes
3. **Accessibility**: Baseline violations documented for improvement tracking
4. **Performance**: Metrics captured for before/after comparison
5. **Automation**: Scripts make testing repeatable and consistent

## 🚀 Ready for Day 1

All infrastructure is in place. The next step is to run the baseline tests to document current button behavior before starting the actual migration.
