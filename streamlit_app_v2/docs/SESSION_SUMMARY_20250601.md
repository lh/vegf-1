# Session Summary - 1st June 2025

## Overview
Integrated the enhanced "Source-Colored with Terminal Status Colors" Sankey visualisation into the main Analysis Overview page, along with a comprehensive export configuration system.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Export Configuration System
- Created `utils/export_config.py` with user-selectable export formats:
  - PNG (with quality scale slider)
  - SVG (vector format)
  - JPEG (compressed)
  - WebP (modern format)
- Initially included PDF but removed after discovering Plotly limitations
- Added export settings to sidebar without verbose explanations
- Applied export configuration to all Plotly charts

### 2. Sankey Visualisation Enhancement
- Integrated the specific "Source-Colored with Terminal Status Colors" style
- Updated `sankey_builder_enhanced.py` with:
  - Pre-Treatment node removal
  - Shortened labels (Initial, Intensive, Regular, etc.)
  - Terminal nodes colored by status (green=continuing, red=discontinued)
  - Fixed positioning for better alignment
  - Removed redundant chart titles and annotations

### 3. UI Simplification
- Removed destination-coloured option (kept only source-coloured)
- Removed "Show Active at End" checkbox (always show best version)
- Removed timing messages ("Extracting patterns..." etc.)
- Removed mobile-friendly export options
- Made interpretation guide always visible as a two-column panel
- Moved analysis description to info panel at bottom
- Removed redundant "Treatment Pattern Analysis" text

### 4. British Spelling Updates
- Changed all instances of "visualization" to "visualisation"
- Updated subheader to "Patient Journey Visualisation"

### 5. Clean Interface
- Treatment Patterns is now the first tab as requested ("pretty and useful")
- Removed redundant titles and partially obscured text
- Less clutter, more focus on the beautiful visualisation

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `components/treatment_patterns/enhanced_tab.py` - Simplified UI, removed options
- `components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder_enhanced.py` - Implemented terminal status colors
- `components/treatment_patterns/pattern_analyzer.py` - Removed timing messages
- `pages/3_Analysis_Overview.py` - Reordered tabs, added export settings
- `utils/visualization_modes.py` - Already had terminal colors defined
- `utils/export_config.py` - New centralised export system

### Export System Architecture
The new export configuration system provides:
- Session state persistence for user preferences
- Format-specific optimizations (e.g., web-safe fonts for SVG)
- Pre-configured settings for common chart types
- Easy integration with existing Plotly charts

## Next Steps
The enhanced Sankey visualisation with export controls is now fully integrated into the main application. Users can enjoy the beautiful "Source-Colored with Terminal Status Colors" style with easy export options in their preferred format.

## Note
All tests passed successfully before committing. The changes have been pushed to the `dev/next-features` branch.
