# Session Summary - June 1, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on completing the Sankey visualization integration, fixing UI/UX issues, centralizing color definitions, and future-proofing the codebase against pandas deprecations.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Sankey Visualization Enhancements

#### Completed Integration
- Successfully integrated enhanced Sankey visualizations into the Analysis Overview page
- Made Sankey the primary visualization in the Treatment Patterns tab
- Fixed missing imports and dependencies

#### UI/UX Improvements
- Changed to British English spellings throughout (Colours, Visualisation, etc.)
- Fixed legend positioning (moved from right to bottom to prevent cutoff)
- Reduced visualization height from 800px to 600px for better viewport fit
- Improved label readability (increased font size, removed invalid styling)
- Renamed "Semantic Colours" to "Destination-Coloured" for clarity
- Removed unnecessary "Flow Colours" legend
- Made Source-Coloured the default option
- Removed Basic grayscale option entirely

#### Terminal Nodes Feature
- Implemented "Show Active at End" checkbox to display patients still in treatment
- Created `pattern_analyzer_enhanced.py` to add terminal transitions
- Created `sankey_builder_enhanced.py` with special styling for terminal nodes
- Terminal nodes show as "Still in [State] (Year X)" with dashed borders
- Fixed destination coloring to work properly with terminal nodes

### 2. Color System Centralization

#### Problem Solved
- Colors were defined in multiple places across the codebase
- Risk of inconsistency and maintenance issues

#### Implementation
- Added treatment pattern colors to `utils/visualization_modes.py`
- Updated all Sankey builders to use `get_treatment_state_colors()`
- Updated terminal node colors to use the central system
- Removed all hardcoded color dictionaries

#### Files Updated
- `components/treatment_patterns/pattern_analyzer.py`
- `components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder.py`
- `components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder_enhanced.py`
- `components/treatment_patterns/pattern_analyzer_enhanced.py`

### 3. Layout and Spacing Improvements

#### Problems Fixed
- Cramping on the right side of Sankey diagrams
- Terminal nodes overlapping or too close together

#### Solutions
- Increased node padding from 30 to 40 pixels
- Increased right margin from 10 to 150 pixels for terminal views
- Reduced font size from 12 to 11 for better fit
- Increased height from 700 to 800 pixels for terminal views

### 4. Pandas Future-Proofing

#### Fixed Deprecation Warnings
1. **Boolean Downcasting Warning**
   - Changed `.fillna(False).astype('bool')` to `.astype('boolean').fillna(False)`
   - Uses pandas' nullable boolean dtype for proper NaN handling

2. **DataFrame Concatenation Warning**
   - Changed `None` to `np.nan` for missing numeric values
   - Added explicit dtype matching before concatenation
   - Ensures consistent data types across DataFrames

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive guide: `docs/PANDAS_FUTURE_PROOFING.md`
- Explains root causes and solutions
- Provides best practices for future development

## Technical Details

### New Functions Added
- `create_enhanced_sankey_with_terminals()` - Source-colored with terminal nodes
- `create_enhanced_sankey_with_terminals_destination_colored()` - Destination-colored with terminal nodes
- `get_terminal_node_colors()` - Centralized terminal node colors

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `KeyError: 'visit_number'` by using correct column name `visit_num`
- Fixed missing columns in terminal transitions
- Fixed dtype mismatches in DataFrame concatenation

## Files Modified
1. `/pages/3_Analysis_Overview.py` - Integrated enhanced patterns tab
2. `/components/treatment_patterns/enhanced_tab.py` - Added terminal node controls
3. `/components/treatment_patterns/pattern_analyzer.py` - Fixed pandas warnings
4. `/components/treatment_patterns/pattern_analyzer_enhanced.py` - Added terminal transitions
5. `/components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder.py` - Centralized colors
6. `/components/treatment_patterns/sankey_builder_enhanced.py` - Enhanced terminal support
7. `/utils/visualization_modes.py` - Added treatment pattern colors
8. `/components/treatment_patterns/__init__.py` - Exported new functions

## Key Insights

### Gap Analysis Discovery
- Investigated "missing" patients in Sankey diagrams
- Found 2,049 patients (8.6%) still in Maximum Extension at simulation end
- Sankey only shows transitions, not patients remaining in states
- Led to the development of the terminal nodes feature

### Color System Benefits
- Single source of truth for all colors
- Automatic adaptation based on visualization mode
- Easier maintenance and consistency
- No duplicate definitions

### Future-Proofing Value
- Code ready for pandas 2.x and beyond
- Follows recommended best practices
- Explicit type handling prevents surprises
- Better code clarity and maintainability

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Consider adding export functionality for Sankey diagrams
- Add filters for specific time periods or patient cohorts
- Implement interactive features (click to filter, hover for details)
- Add comparison mode for different protocols

## Summary
This session successfully enhanced the Treatment Patterns visualization with professional Sankey diagrams, centralized the styling system, and ensured the codebase is ready for future pandas versions. The application now provides clearer insights into patient treatment flows while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
