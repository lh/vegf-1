# Performance Improvements Summary

## Overview
Fixed multiple performance issues in the Analysis Overview page, achieving dramatic speedups through vectorization and caching.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vision Histograms Were Instant (But Misleading)
- **Issue**: Histograms appeared instant because they were cached AND only showing 5,000 patients
- **Fix**: Removed unnecessary sampling - now shows ALL patients
- **Result**: Still fast because vectorized operations handle 10,000+ patients easily

### 2. Treatment Patterns Were Very Slow
- **Root Cause**: Using nested for loops to calculate intervals
  - Loop through each patient (10,000 iterations)
  - Loop through each visit per patient (20 iterations)
  - Total: 200,000+ loop iterations in Python!
- **Fix 1**: Added `@st.cache_data` decorator for immediate relief
- **Fix 2**: Replaced loops with vectorized pandas operations using `groupby().shift()`
- **Result**: **112x faster** (0.58s → 0.005s for 1,000 patients)

## Technical Details

### Old Implementation (Slow)
```python
intervals = []
for patient_id in visits_df['patient_id'].unique():  # 10,000 loops
    patient_visits = visits_df[visits_df['patient_id'] == patient_id]
    for i in range(1, len(times)):  # 20 loops per patient
        intervals.append({...})  # 200,000 appends!
```

### New Implementation (Fast)
```python
# Vectorized using pandas
visits_df['prev_time'] = visits_df.groupby('patient_id')['time_years'].shift(1)
visits_df['interval_days'] = (visits_df['time_years'] - visits_df['prev_time']) * 365
intervals_df = visits_df[visits_df['prev_time'].notna()]
```

## Performance Improvements

### Vision Statistics (Already Optimized)
- Was: Patient-by-patient loop
- Now: `groupby().agg(['first', 'last'])`
- Speedup: **2,793x** (9s → 0.003s)

### Treatment Intervals (Just Fixed)
- Was: Nested for loops
- Now: Vectorized with `shift()`
- Speedup: **112x** (0.58s → 0.005s)

### Caching Strategy
- Vision statistics: Cached with `@st.cache_data`
- Treatment intervals: Now cached with `@st.cache_data`
- Summary statistics: Cached with `@st.cache_data`

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- Vision histograms: Instant (but only showing half the data)
- Treatment patterns: Several seconds of loading
- Tab switching: Slow and frustrating

### After:
- Vision histograms: Instant (showing ALL data)
- Treatment patterns: Instant (cached + vectorized)
- Tab switching: Smooth and responsive

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always vectorize DataFrame operations** - avoid Python loops
2. **Cache expensive calculations** with `@st.cache_data`
3. **Profile before optimizing** - the slow part wasn't where expected
4. **Don't sacrifice accuracy for speed** unless necessary
5. **Pandas groupby operations are incredibly powerful**

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

1. Patient trajectories plot still uses a for loop (but limited to 20-100 patients)
2. Could pre-calculate more statistics during simulation
3. Could add progress bars for initial calculations
