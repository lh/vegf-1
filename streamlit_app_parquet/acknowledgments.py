Acknowledgments Module

This module contains acknowledgment information for external code and resources

This Streamlit implementation is inspired by and adapted from the Project_Toy_MECC
repository originally created by Dom Rowney (https://github.com/DomRowney/Project_Toy_MECC)
and further developed at https://github.com/Bergam0t/Project_Toy_MECC.

The original repository demonstrates an excellent approach for combining Streamlit
for interactive visualization with Quarto for report generation. We've adapted
several patterns from their implementation, particularly:
- The Streamlit interactive dashboard structure
- The Quarto integration for report generation, which was specifically
  contributed by Sammi Rosser, including the clever runtime installation
  of Quarto within Streamlit Cloud environments

We're grateful to the authors for sharing their work openly, which has significantly
informed our approach to visualising simulation results.

Special thanks to Sammi Rosser for their work on the Quarto integration for report generation,
including the innovative approach to installing Quarto within Streamlit Cloud environments.
