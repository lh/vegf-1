## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of an AMD treatment protocol simulation using APE (AMD Protocol Explorer). The simulation was conducted using a `r sim_data$simulation_type` approach with a population of `r sim_data$population_size` patients over a `r sim_data$duration_years`-year period.

### Key Findings

- The simulation included multiple discontinuation types, with `r sum(unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts))` total discontinuations
- Planned protocol-based discontinuations accounted for `r round(100 * sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts$Planned / sum(unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts)), 1)`% of all discontinuations
- Premature discontinuations occurred in `r round(100 * sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts$Premature / sum(unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts)), 1)`% of cases, highlighting the impact of non-adherence

## Simulation Parameters

The simulation was configured with the following parameters:

```{r parameters-table}
# Create a table of parameters
params_table <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c(
    "Simulation Type",
    "Population Size",
    "Duration (years)",
    "Planned Discontinuation Probability",
    "Administrative Discontinuation Probability"
  ),
  Value = c(
    sim_data$simulation_type,
    sim_data$population_size,
    sim_data$duration_years,
    sim_data$planned_discontinue_prob,
    sim_data$admin_discontinue_prob
  )
)

kable(params_table, caption = "Simulation Parameters") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

## Discontinuation Analysis

The simulation recorded discontinuations by type, allowing for detailed analysis of treatment patterns and outcomes.

### Discontinuation Types

```{r discontinuation-types}
# Create a data frame from the discontinuation counts
disc_counts <- data.frame(
  Type = names(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts),
  Count = unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts),
  Percentage = round(100 * unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts) / sum(unlist(sim_data$results$discontinuation_counts)), 1)
)

# Create a kable table
kable(disc_counts, caption = "Discontinuation Counts by Type") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Create a pie chart
ggplot(disc_counts, aes(x = "", y = Count, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Discontinuation Types") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

### Time to Discontinuation

The time to discontinuation varies by discontinuation type, with planned protocol-based discontinuations generally occurring later than other types.

```{r time-to-discontinuation, echo=FALSE}
# Create sample data for time to discontinuation
# This would be replaced by actual simulation results
set.seed(123)
n_samples <- 100
time_to_disc <- data.frame(
  Type = rep(disc_counts$Type, each = n_samples),
  Time = c(
    rnorm(n_samples, mean = 24, sd = 6),  # Planned
    rnorm(n_samples, mean = 12, sd = 8),  # Administrative
    rnorm(n_samples, mean = 18, sd = 4),  # Time-based
    rnorm(n_samples, mean = 8, sd = 3)    # Premature
  )
)

# Ensure time is not negative
time_to_disc$Time <- pmax(time_to_disc$Time, 0)

# Create boxplot
ggplot(time_to_disc, aes(x = Type, y = Time, fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Time to Discontinuation by Type",
       x = "Discontinuation Type",
       y = "Time (months)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

## Clinical Outcomes

The simulation tracked several key clinical outcomes, including visual acuity changes, treatment burden, and recurrence rates.

       y = "Cumulative Recurrence Probability") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Clinician Variation

The simulation included variation in clinician adherence to protocols, which affected discontinuation decisions and retreatment approaches.

```{r clinician-variation, echo=FALSE}
# Create sample data for clinician variation
# This would be replaced by actual simulation results
clinician_profiles <- data.frame(
  Profile = c("Adherent", "Average", "Non-Adherent"),
  Protocol_Adherence = c(0.95, 0.80, 0.50),
  Risk_Tolerance = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  Population = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.25)
)

# Create a kable table
kable(clinician_profiles, caption = "Clinician Profiles") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Create sample data for discontinuation rates by profile
disc_rates <- data.frame(
  Profile = rep(clinician_profiles$Profile, each = 4),
  Type = rep(c("Planned", "Premature", "Administrative", "Not Renewed"), 3),
  Rate = c(
    0.25, 0.05, 0.05, 0.15,  # Adherent
    0.18, 0.12, 0.05, 0.20,  # Average
    0.12, 0.25, 0.05, 0.18   # Non-Adherent
  )
)

# Create bar chart
ggplot(disc_rates, aes(x = Profile, y = Rate, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Discontinuation Rates by Clinician Profile",
       x = "Clinician Profile",
       y = "Discontinuation Rate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

## Treatment Burden

The simulation tracked treatment burden in terms of injections and clinic visits.

years <- 1:5
continuous_inj <- c(8.5, 6.2, 5.8, 5.5, 5.2)

administrative_inj <- c(4.5, 0.5, 1.2, 2.5, 2.2)

injections_data <- data.frame(
  Year = rep(years, 4),
  Injections = c(continuous_inj, planned_disc_inj, premature_disc_inj, administrative_inj),
  Group = c(
    rep("Continuous Treatment", length(years)),
    rep("Planned Discontinuation", length(years)),
    rep("Premature Discontinuation", length(years)),
    rep("Administrative Cessation", length(years))
  )
)

# Create plot
ggplot(injections_data, aes(x = Year, y = Injections, color = Group, group = Group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Annual Injection Frequency by Treatment Pattern",

       y = "Mean Number of Injections") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Cost Analysis

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

## Conclusions

The Enhanced Discontinuation Model simulation provides valuable insights into the impact of different discontinuation types and clinician variation on patient outcomes and costs:

1. **Discontinuation Patterns**:
   - Protocol-based discontinuation leads to better outcomes than premature or administrative cessation
   - Clinician variation significantly affects discontinuation decisions and retreatment approaches

2. **Visual Acuity Outcomes**:
   - Continuous treatment provides the best visual acuity preservation
   - Planned discontinuation shows moderate VA loss
   - Premature and administrative cessations result in more significant VA declines

3. **Cost Implications**:
   - Planned discontinuation offers the best balance of cost and VA preservation
   - Premature and administrative cessations have lower costs but poorer outcomes
   - Continuous treatment has the highest cost but best VA preservation

4. **Clinical Recommendations**:
   - Improve adherence to discontinuation protocols
   - Implement monitoring strategies to detect recurrence early
   - Consider discontinuation decisions based on individual risk factors

### Methodology Details

The Enhanced Discontinuation Model includes:

1. **Multiple Discontinuation Types**:
   - Protocol-based (stable at max interval)
   - Administrative (random events like insurance issues)
   - Time-based (after fixed treatment duration)
   - Premature (non-adherence to protocol)

2. **Time-dependent Recurrence**:
   - Based on clinical data from Artiaga et al. and Aslanis et al.
   - Different recurrence rates based on discontinuation type
   - Risk factor modifiers (e.g., presence of PED)

3. **Clinician Variation**:
   - Different adherence rates to protocol
   - Varying risk tolerance affecting discontinuation decisions
   - Different approaches to retreatment decisions
