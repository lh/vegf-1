# Discontinuation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Core Simulation Issues
1. The AMD simulation models were showing mathematically impossible discontinuation rates exceeding 100%. Specifically, the ABS simulation showed 129.2% discontinuation rate with 1000 patients.
2. Double-counting of discontinuation events instead of unique patients
3. Re-discontinuation events being counted as separate patients 

### Integration Issues
4. Fixed integration between simulation and Streamlit UI for discontinuation statistics
5. Ensured fixed implementations properly track discontinuation statistics
6. Created verification scripts that avoid using synthetic data
7. Fixed file path issues in verification scripts for saving plots

## Root Cause
1. **Double-Counting**: The discontinuation manager was being called twice for each evaluation, resulting in duplicate discontinuation events
2. **Event vs. Patient Tracking**: The system was counting total discontinuation events rather than unique patients who discontinued treatment
3. **Re-Discontinuation Counting**: When a patient discontinued treatment, was later retreated, and then discontinued again, each event was counted separately instead of counting unique patients

## Solution Implemented

### Architecture Changes
1. **Separation of Concerns**: We implemented a refactored discontinuation manager that separates decision logic from state changes
   - Created `RefactoredDiscontinuationManager` with pure functions that return decisions without side effects
   - Created `CompatibilityDiscontinuationManager` as a wrapper for backward compatibility

2. **Unique Patient Tracking**: We added explicit tracking of unique patients who discontinued 
   - Using sets to store patient IDs ensures each patient is only counted once
   - Added separate tracking for discontinuations vs. retreatments

3. **Return Value Handling**: We updated both implementations to handle multiple return types
   - Both object-based return values (new style)
   - Tuple-based return values (compatibility layer)

### Implementation Details
1. Fixed `treat_and_extend_abs_fixed.py`:
   - Added tracking of unique discontinued patients using a set
   - Properly extracted discontinuation decision values
   - Fixed the monitoring visit scheduling code to use the extracted `cessation_type` variable

2. Fixed `treat_and_extend_des_fixed.py`:
   - Implemented the same tracking approach as in the ABS model
   - Fixed the same issue with monitoring visit scheduling

3. Updated Streamlit integration:
   - Modified visualization to show both raw event counts and unique patient counts
   - Ensured correct calculation and display of discontinuation rates
   - Ensured UI uses real simulation data without synthetic placeholders

## Verification

Two verification scripts were created:

1. `verify_fixed_discontinuation.py` - Verifies the simulation implementations correctly track discontinuation statistics
2. `verify_streamlit_integration.py` - Verifies the Streamlit app correctly processes and visualizes the discontinuation data

Both scripts use the official fixed implementations:
- `treat_and_extend_abs_fixed.py`
- `treat_and_extend_des_fixed.py`

The verification follows these principles:
- Uses **only real simulation data** - no synthetic/mock data
- Fails fast when required data is missing
- Verifies data conservation (total patient counts remain consistent)
- Validates that discontinuation tracking works correctly

## Test Results
The integration tests now pass with the following results:

### ABS Model
- **Total Patients**: 10
- **Unique Discontinued Patients**: 6
- **Discontinuation Rate**: 60.0%
- Visualizations show correct data

### DES Model
- **Total Patients**: 10
- **Unique Discontinued Patients**: 3
- **Discontinuation Rate**: 30.0%
- Visualizations show correct data

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Statistics**: Discontinuation rates are now mathematically correct (≤100%)
2. **Improved Clarity**: Explicit distinction between event counts and unique patient counts
3. **Better Visualizations**: Added comparative visualization showing events vs. unique patients
4. **Safer Implementation**: Properly handled different return types for backward compatibility
5. **Better Code Structure**: Clear separation between decision logic and state management
6. **Scientific Integrity**: Eliminated synthetic data in visualizations to maintain data integrity

## Remaining Considerations
1. There is a discrepancy between the simulation's tracking of unique discontinued patients and the discontinuation manager's internal tracking. This is shown in warnings like:
   ```
   WARNING: Discrepancy in unique discontinued patients: simulation=6, manager=0
   ```
   This doesn't affect the calculation of rates but should be investigated in the future for consistency.

2. Some duplicate registrations are noted in the logs, showing patients already being registered as discontinued:
   ```
   Patient PATIENT005, already registered as discontinued
   ```
   These don't affect the unique count (since sets prevent duplicates) but indicate areas where the code flow could be optimized.

## Next Steps

1. Remove any synthetic data generators from the codebase
2. Update documentation to emphasize that only real simulation data should be used
3. Consider refactoring the visualization code to always use direct simulation data
4. Add tests to verify that no synthetic data generators are being used in production code

✅ All verification tests are now passing with the fixed implementations.
